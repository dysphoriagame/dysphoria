&lt;div&gt;	Like so many other aspiring adventurers, you find yourself newly-arrived in the Adventurers’ Guild hall, nearly lost in the sea of recruits spilling in through the doors. The guild hall bristles with activity, the air taut with urgency. Guildmates bustle wild-eyed newcomers into whatever gear is on hand, veteran adventurers shouting over the din— “Our party needs another ranger, find us a ranger why don’t you!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Our party has an opening for a knight!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Where is our guardian? Ye Olde Evil’s minions will attack any moment now!”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Register for the guild and join an adventuring party here!” a narrow-faced guild master calls, standing on a table and waving a handful of scrolls. Pulled along by the jostling chaos, you end up at the front of the line. The guild member [[peers down at you.]]

	“Lucky for you, younglin’, we had some spare guardian gear lyin’ around. Save you a trip to the smithy. It ought to fit, more or less.” Brutus grabs a long robe, a buckler, and a scepter from under the table and drops them into your arms. They are hardly heavy, and yet you nearly stumble beneath the sudden weight, more out of shock than anything else. You stare at the bundle in your arms. He simply gave you a guardian’s gear? You weren’t even allowed a choice? 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“You can buy better gear once you have the gold for it. For now, this will do,” Brutus continues.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You try to nod and smile—he is, after all, only trying to be helpful—but in the back of your mind, you are already plotting to exchange this coarse robe and useless scepter for a proper &lt;%= s.ROLE.toLowerCase() %&gt;’s set of gear.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Suddenly, a loud horn blares [[through the hall.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{warriorbg.png}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="through the hall." tags="" position="25,1025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“And that there is our cue,” Brutus says, grabbing his own sword and shield. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	All around you, parties of adventurers hastily don their gear and begin flooding out of the hall, the deep bellows of the horn echoing off wall and ceiling. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Our cue for what?” you ask as Orante helps you into your robe and fastens your buckler to your arm. The small, round shield grips your forearm, vise-like. The robe is coarse and far too large. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus bares his fangs in a wide grin, dark pupils flaring.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Ye Olde Evil’s minions are swarmin’ the beaches just outside of Cysa. Our first quest is to clear them out and defend the city. Now hurry along, no more time for explainin’!”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Before you know it, you are being dragged to the outskirts of the city, embarking on your first adventure not as a &lt;%=s.ROLE.toLowerCase()%&gt;, but [[as a guardian.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
{squadbg.png}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="as a guardian." tags="" position="25,1150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	The ocean of adventurers splits upon leaving the guild hall. Half of the parties charge to the drawbridge, prepared to defend against the trolls lurching towards the city gates. Your half hurries to the beaches beyond Cysa’s walls, where [goblins] are swarming out of makeshift rafts and vessels. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You do your best to keep up with your party, nearly tripping over the hem of your robe, almost tumbling down the crudely hewn stairs that lead down to the beach. The roar of the sea grows deafeningly loud, no longer dampened by city walls, as your party spills out across the blinding white sands.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“There!” Brutus shouts, pointing at a nearby cluster of goblins. The creatures bare their fangs and hiss. “A little somethin’ to warm us up!” 
You hurry after your party as they [[charge.]]

	Brutus is first into the fray, using his Slash to cleave through the nearest goblin, blood spraying in the wake of his sword. The orc knight gives a triumphant roar, wading further into combat. &lt;if knight&gt; You watch him enviously, imagining what it would be like, to be able to charge into danger so boldly, to be able to wield the brutal power of a sword—to wield anything other than your stupid scepter. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante casts Fireball and hurls the resultant orb of flame at another goblin. The creature shrieks as its cloth armor catches fire, and it flees towards the water.

Incertus slips around the enemies, unnoticed, and plunges his daggers into a goblin archer in the back. He disengages, tugging at the collar of his tunic.

	Brutus uses Shield Bash, violently slamming his kite shield forward. It connects with a goblin’s face, sending the creature flying, dazed, bone and cartilage collapsed by this brutish assault. The last goblin standing shrieks in alarm and begins to scramble away.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante whispers an incantation and twists her fingers above her tome. Ice settles over the fleeing goblin, freezing it in place.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Incertus moves so swiftly, she almost seems to teleport to the frozen goblin, her daggers sliding between its ribs before the creature even has time to react. She steps away as Orante’s Freeze swallows up the rest of its body, leaving an ice statue stained by two [[blooms of crimson.]] 
&lt;div hidden class=&quot;rogue&quot;&gt;

	“Lucky,” Brutus spits.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Weak,” the goblin sneers, slicing Brutus across the upper arm. The orc knight’s eyes nearly bulge from his head.

	You take a deep breath, clutching your scepter. You are tempted to simply chuck the useless thing at the nearest goblin’s head. Maybe the buckler too—and why not just smother the goblin in your ugly robe, for good measure?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“A heal, younglin’! I need a heal” Brutus shouts, clutching his arm.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You sigh and try to channel a heal through your scepter. This time, you do manage to heal someone. Unfortunately, that someone is [[not Brutus.]]

	“A blind, younglin’! Daze these disgustin’ creatures for me!” Brutus shouts, clutching his arm.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You sigh and point your scepter at the goblin warriors, doing your very best to channel Blind. Your scepter glows weakly, before sputtering out altogether. One of the goblins cackles at you. You grit your teeth; now you really want to throw your scepter through its head. Or, better yet, use &lt;%= s.ROLE.toLowerCase() %&gt;’s gear to slay it like a proper &lt;%= s.ROLE.toLowerCase() %&gt;, instead of trying to make do with this nonsense!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus hefts his shield, spitting on the frozen goblin warrior before advancing [[on the second.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

	“I did not require aid,” Orante murmurs.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The goblin archer lets loose an arrow. It grazes Orante’s shoulder, leaving a thin line of blood in its wake. Your Mend slowly closes the small wound, restoring her pale skin. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Preemptive healing?” you suggest.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	She purses her lips, giving you a highly skeptical look.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus hefts his shield, spitting on the frozen goblin warrior before advancing [[on the second.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="on the second." tags="" position="25,2150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	The second goblin warrior’s taunts are cut short after it takes a mouthful of Brutus’s shield.
The goblin shaman gives one last squeak and keels over, overcome by the poison. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante conjures up a swirling sphere of fire and hurls it at the goblin archer. The nimble archer dances backwards to avoid it—and dodges right into Incertus’s waiting blades. After the body drops, she hastily bends over not the body, but the weapon it once carried. You frown. You look around, but no one else seems to have noticed the rogue’s antics.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Another victory,” Orante hums happily. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Not quite,” Brutus growls, gripping his sword as he storms towards the [[frozen goblin warrior.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
{magebg.png}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="frozen goblin warrior." tags="" position="33,2401" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	Orante inhales sharply, aware of Brutus’s intentions before anyone else. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Surely that is not necessary—” she begins—but is cut off by the first swing of Brutus’s blade. One ice-encrusted goblin arm falls to the ground, chopped off by the orc knight.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“No one,” he rumbles, hacking at the other arm, “no one calls me weak and lives to tell the tale.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	With a final grunt of effort, he lops the goblin’s head off, the creature’s face trapped in a permanent sneer as it [[rolls down the beach.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;
{dedgoblinbg.png}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="You slowly turn." tags="" position="35,2651" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	“Ah. A [troll],” Orante observes. “Must have escaped the fight at the gates.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The lumbering creature stomps across the beach, an earthshattering bellow breaking free of its malformed face as it carelessly knocks adventurer after adventurer aside. Ranger arrows and mage spells bounce harmlessly off the calcified leather of its flesh, and its massive club—fashioned from an uprooted tree, by the looks of it—sweeps entire parties out of its way. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Finally! A challenge!” Brutus says.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Your party moves towards the troll as it flattens another adventuring party. You hurry along behind them, clutching your robes so you [[do not trip.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

{trollbg.png}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="do not trip." tags="" position="24,2519" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	Brutus reaches the troll first, slashing at the thick folds of flesh pillowing around its legs. His sword apparently slices something vital, for the troll stumbles and falls on one knee with a startled cry—but not before smashing its club into Brutus and sending the orc knight flying. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante casts Fireball. The orb of flame splashes across the troll’s flattened face, lighting the sparse hairs on its scalp on fire. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The troll paws at the new pain on its head in confusion, absentmindedly swinging its club, the crude weapon’s blunt end nearly hitting Incertus and Orante. The rogue hastily uses Dodge; she almost seems to recede into her own shadow, shrinking back and avoiding all harm. Orante, on the other hand, does not avoid any harm at all—rather, she is flung several feet backwards, her tome tumbling from her grasp.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="It is your turn to act." tags="" position="186,2630" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	[[You could use Blind.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	[[Or you could cease this masquerade.]] You did not join the Adventurers’ Guild to do poorly as a guardian. You came here to be the best &lt;%= s.ROLE %&gt; the land has ever seen.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Did I help?” you ask.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	He coughs again.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Yes! Of course, younglin’!” he shouts back, but the way he gingerly touches his ribs [[suggests otherwise.]]

	You try to summon what concentration you have left, doing your best to stifle the doubting clamor at the back of your mind. You direct your scepter towards the troll, channeling Blind. A dull glow emanates from the end of your scepter. The troll stares dumbly at it, hardly blinded, but certainly mesmerized by the little flickering light.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	 Brutus gives a violent cough and manages to struggle back onto his feet, sword and shield in hand. He gives your scepter a decidedly unimpressed look.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Ah, yes, just…keep doin’ that, recruit, keep him distracted,” the orc knight shouts.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	His yelling snaps the troll out of its hypnosis. With an incensed roar, it charges at your party [[once more.-&gt;suggests otherwise.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

	You charge the troll, raising your buckler as if it is a kite shield, brandishing your scepter as if it is a sword. Brutus gives a startled yell.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“What are you doin’, recruit?!” 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You ignore him and continue running forward. The troll gives a heaving roar and swings its club at you. You stumble out of the way just in time, sand spraying around you as the club smashes into the ground. Seeing your opening in the troll’s sluggish reflexes and slow recovery, you smash the knobbed end of your scepter against its fingers. There is a crack, a deafening grunt of pain—and then the troll reels backwards, nursing its broken hand, [[club forgotten.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div hidden class=&quot;mage&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“What are you doin’, recruit?!”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You ignore him and flip to a dogeared page, hands already moving through the air in complex patterns, lips already moving in the shapes of incantations. You slip into the role of mage with utmost ease—and, for the first time since you embarked on this adventure, you feel completely comfortable and entirely capable.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	A thick shell of ice winds up the troll’s legs, fixing it to the ground. It gives an incensed roar, struggling against its sudden bonds, but [[it cannot move.-&gt;club forgotten.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div hidden class=&quot;rogue&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“What are you doin’, recruit?!”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
   	You ignore him and hurl your buckler at the troll. The round, wooden shield smashes into its nose with a soft crunch; the troll lurches backwards, clutching at its face in pain. Taking advantage of this distraction, you run behind the troll and begin clambering up its back, using the tufts of hair sprouting from its hardened skin as handholds until your feet are planted on its shoulders. You take your scepter and plunge its sharper end into the troll’s eye.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The massive creature gives a wail of pain and shudders to its knees, pitching you off its shoulders and [[into the sand.-&gt;club forgotten.]]

	Brutus charges towards the troll once more as Incertus circles behind the massive creature. As the knight distracts the troll with his glancing sword blows and clanging shield, the rogue runs up the misshapen monster’s back, nimble and noiseless. Before the troll can even realize there is an unwanted guest standing on its shoulders, Incertus slices its throat.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	It stands there for a moment, swaying, too dumb to register its own demise. It gives one last groan, and then finally collapses in a spray of sand, Incertus gracefully leaping clear. The final foe on the beach has been felled by a stunning display of teamwork and skill—and you? You could only watch uselessly.

	“Congratulations on finishin’ your first adventure in one piece!” he laughs.

However, it does not take them long to recognize the opening you have just given them, and they hastily surge forward to aid you. As the troll reels with pain, Brutus charges it from the front, and Incertus circles around to its rear. While the knight lays blow after blow upon its tough hide, the rogue runs up the misshapen monster’s back, nimble and noiseless. Before the troll can even realize there is an unwanted guest standing on its shoulders, Incertus [[slices its throat.]]

You can feel Orante’s cool gaze on you as well. The room suddenly feels too hot and small, the air itself stifled by the pressure.

	Brutus’s nostrils flare.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“I did not need help,” he growls. He takes a breath, calming himself. “I was fine. We were fine.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“I meant no offense—” you say quickly.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“None taken, recruit. But we need to work together as a party. We do need a guardian—you know that, yes? We’ll only reach Ye Olde Evil if we have a sturdy, dependable guardian to support us—and you do want to be the party that defeats Ye Olde Evil, yes?”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Of course I do, but—” [[you begin.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="pointed look." tags="" position="1025,275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	Orante returns Brutus’s look and clears her throat.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Be that as it may, we are not in particular need of another mage,” she says softly.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“But I was helpful! I froze the troll in place so Brutus and Incertus could finish it off!” you protest. “You were…well, you had been knocked unconscious, so I…you know. I helped my party.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante purses her lips. Perhaps reminding her of her own tumble at the beach had not been particularly prudent, but every word you said was true. You can tell she realizes this as well, even in spite of the skeptical look on her face. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Well,” she says at last, “why don’t you go to the marketplace and spend your well-deserved gold? Brutus and I have plans to discuss—and where is Incertus?” You hadn’t even noticed that the [[rogue had disappeared.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="room." tags="" position="1150,275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	You also look around the room, wondering if Incertus is particularly offended by the presence of a second rogue in the party. However, she is nowhere to be found. Curious. You never even saw her slip away.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Incertus didn’t seem to mind the extra help,” you point out. “In fact, she even copied my move later—you know, the one where I ran up the troll’s back to reach its head—”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Of course she did,” Brutus grunts. “It is a classic move used against tall foes. All the best rogues use it—”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	He quickly stops himself, but it is too late.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Right? See?” you say excitedly. “All the best rogues use it! So, if I used it, does that make me—” 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“As do I, younglin’. As do I.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
He looks as if he’s about to continue, but Orante smoothly cuts him off.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“&lt;%= s.NAME %&gt;, why don’t you go to the marketplace and spend your well-deserved gold?” she says gently. “Brutus and I have plans to discuss—and where is Incertus?” You hadn’t even noticed that the rogue had disappeared.

&lt;div&gt;
	“Sure. I’ll be back later,” you say.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;	The apothecary shop would have been a decent-sized shop, if not for the clutter. The shelves seem to lean forward precariously, each level in danger of spilling its precious cargo of containers. Jars, bottles, vials, pails, pans, pots, and upturned helms have all been employed to carry some sort of powder or liquid or dried animal part. Crates crowd the floor, each filled beyond their brims with leathered hides, exotic flora, and assorted bones. Piles of books vie for space amidst the mess. Strange creatures squawk and screech from cages hanging overhead.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The [apothecary] herself peers up from her mortar and pestle, and the thing she had been trying to pulverize takes this opportunity to escape.

&lt;div&gt;
	The smithy greets you with a blast of hot air and the rhythmic din of metal upon metal. The forge is stained by a hundred vermillion hues, the stone walls colourless without the violent flashes of fire and brilliant sprays of sparks. The furnace flares and growls in the back, illuminating the apprentices working at the anvils. Weapons and armors hang in rows against the walls, some sorely in need of repair, some polished and gleaming. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The [blacksmith] moves to the counter, wiping his hands off on his apron.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“New adventurer, eh?” he asks, looking you over. “You must have helped fend off the latest assault by Ye Olde Evil’s minions.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Indeed, I did,” you say. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Then I thank you for it. I take it you’re looking for an upgrade after your first adventure, eh?”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You nod.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Let’s take a look at your scroll then, eh?”

	“Just looking, are ye? Fer anything in particular?”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	She moves around behind the counter, grabbing jars off shelves and brandishing them about. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Perhaps ye need a potion that makes yer foes walk and talk backwards? A concoction that turns yer skin bright blue? Or are ye looking for a pill or powder that can improve yer performance in bed?” She looks you up and down. “Heavens knows ye’ll need it.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“You know what? I think I’m fine. I’ll be going now,” you say quickly, already moving towards the door.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	“Ah. Right. Scroll. Role. Yes.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You fumble around in your satchel, fingers eventually finding the scroll at the bottom of the bag. You numbly hand it over to the blacksmith. The burly dwarf opens it, occasionally glancing at you over the top of the paper. You feel your cheeks flush. You had planned on buying &lt;role&gt; gear; seems your plans have been foiled.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“A guardian, eh?” He returns the scroll and turns to rummage through a nearby rack of gear. “I have just the thing. A sturdy robe, with protective lining to defend against blade and arrow alike, and charmed cloth to ward against magical spells. A staff, good for channeling guardian skills. And, of course, a buckler, to protect against melee attacks.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

His beard is trimmed uncharacteristically short—you imagine it would have been a fire hazard otherwise—and his wind-worn face is covered in dark blue tattoos. A thick ring dangles from one ear, glinting gold in the firelight. You eye his arms; every time they move his muscles seem to grapple with each other for room. The longer you watch, the more disturbed you grow. Surely that isn’t natural? </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="apothecary" tags="" position="1025,650" size="100,100">An old woman, one eye gone milky white, the other in a permanent squint.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“We forge the very best here,” the blacksmith says proudly. However, his shrewd eyes are still studying your face. “Thank you for your business.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

Except, Incertus no longer looks quite like a “him” anymore; free of his loose cloak and heavy cowl, a cascade of hair falls across his shoulders, and his skinny chest is bound tightly by bandages. In fact, now that you look closer, his hairless face does look a bit feminine…
&lt;/div&gt;

	“Um…uh…I’m sorry, it’s just…I thought you were a man,” you stammer.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Incertus’s face colours a bit, but any flushing is chased away by a furrowed brow and narrowed eyes.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“I am a man. And you are ‘not a guardian.’ Let us keep it that way, why don’t we?” she—he? –says coolly. You wonder if that is a threat.

&lt;div&gt;
    “Glad to see you’re finally awake &lt;%= s.NAME %&gt;,” Brutus rumbles, seeming to have been restored to his jovial self.  “First adventure often takes a lot out of you. Good to see you’re up and about.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Despite seeming like his normal self, it feels as if there’s something off.  It is almost as if he is trying a little too hard to be positive and upbeat.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “What’cha got there?” he asks, gesturing to the scroll clenched tightly in your fist.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “Oh, this? A dwarf knight dropped it off. She said it was from the Guild Master.”  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You hold it out to Brutus, who quickly takes it from your grasp.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “Sounds like Audent. Feisty one, she is. During the defense of the city, she cut off three goblin heads with one swing of her sword.”  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	As he talks about her and breaks the wax seal on the scroll, you swear you hear a tone of admiration in his voice, along with something else you can’t quite put your finger on.  Brutus, ignorant of your analysis of him, unrolls the scroll and begins reading [[to himself.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

He closes the scroll just as Orante and Incertus enter. Incertus is back in his standard outfit, pointedly ignoring your searching gaze.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “What’s that Brutus?” Orante asks, her eyes darting over to you for a second before looking back at him.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “Guild Master gave us a quest.  Rescue a group from Dark Forest. Says nothin’ of fightin’ Ye Olde Evil, though,” Brutus says, a note of disappointment carrying through his voice.  It quickly disappears as he becomes upbeat once more.  “Well, I say there’s no time like the present to get started on a quest!  Get ready, we leave in an hour!” 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	With that Brutus turns and leaves the room, no doubt heading to the blacksmith to pick up some new weaponry.  Orante turns to you, an odd look [[in her eyes.]]

&lt;div&gt;	As Incertus begins to pack his stuff, you clear your throat, trying to get his attention. He ignores you. Finally, you decide to be straightforward ask him about it.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “So...about earlier,” you begin. Before you can say any more, he slips out of the room. You sigh and decide to leave the matter alone for now and begin to [[prepare for your trip.-&gt;Prepare for the trip to the Dark Forest.]]

While the new robe fits much better than the last one, it still does not feel right. You pick up your staff and buckler. They feel unwieldy and lifeless in your hands. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You look in the mirror, at that thing dressed in a guardian&#39;s armor staring blankly back. You recognize more in strangers than you do in your reflection. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	With a heavy, chest-hollowing sigh, you assemble the rest of your gear before heading down to [[set out for the Dark Forest.]]

&lt;div&gt;
	“Now,” he says triumphantly, “we have our victory.”

	Incertus makes a soft noise. You start; you have never heard him make any sort of noise, much less speak.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Almost,” he mutters, pointing past you. His voice is oddly raspy, as if he is forcing it to sound deeper than it is.

	You deliberately slow down while Brutus and Orante obliviously stride on ahead. Incertus matches your pace, until you two are out of earshot.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  	“Listen,” you begin quickly, whispering, “I don’t mean to offend you, but I...I’m just a little confused. About the whole...you know...gender...”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  	Incertus lets out a soft sigh of exasperation. He turns to look at you. He seems more tired than angered, as if this is something he has had to explain before. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
“How odd. I thought you, of all people, would understand,” he murmurs. 
He turns back to face forward and picks up the pace, moving ahead of you. You hurry to catch up with the party, mulling over your thoughts as you [[walk in silence-&gt;Continue to walk in silence.]].

	As the shadows begin to lengthen, you see a cluster of trees not too far away. As the sun sets, the forest only grows more terrifying. Your party decides to push on, determined to get as far in as you can before nightfall. As the shadows continue to grow, you hear faint noises of panting and leaves crackling under weight. As Brutus brings up his shield, three white wolves jump out from the woods on either side of the path, growling menacingly.&lt;br&gt;
	“Let’s show these mutts who the true alphas are,” Brutus growls as he prepares to launch himself into battle. “&lt;%= s.NAME %&gt;, I could use some extra damage, help cut these things down to size.”

	Brutus runs toward the wolves, still roaring. You notice Incertus has disappeared again and Orante is flipping through her spellbook, muttering to herself about a new spell. Brutus uses his Shield Bash, slamming his kite shield into the first wolf, sending it flying backwards a foot or two. Incertus appears to materialize out of thin air just behind it, using his Bleed to open a pulsing vein at its throat, staining its white fur with dark crimson. It quickly bleeds out.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Orante finishes muttering, her hands moving in twisting ways, before unleashing a powerful bolt of blue lightning that strikes the second wolf in the head before bouncing off and colliding with the third wolf. The smell of burnt fur and flesh fills the air as they both fall over, [[dead.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="103" name="dead." tags="" position="625,3250" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
Brutus bangs his chest and lets out a roar of triumph over the bodies of the wolves. He turns to you, baring his fangs in a grin. 
“Taught those mutts a lesson, eh? Since it’s gettin’ dark, we’ll make camp here.” Brutus begins hauling the carcasses of the wolves away so they won’t attract any more animals. “Everyone, get your tents set up. I’ll be back with firewood.”
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
 The rest of you begin busying yourselves with setting up your small, one-person tents, while Orante begins unpacking provisions for dinner. After the fire is made and dinner is prepared and eaten, the issue of shifts comes up. It’s decided that Brutus will take the first shift, followed by Incertus, Orante, and you, before Brutus takes the final watch, by his own insistence. As the fire burns down to embers, Brutus takes his place on a stump and begins sharpening his sword. As you climb into your tent and lay down, you begin [[dozing off]] to the sound of a whetstone against metal.
 &lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="104" name="dozing off" tags="" position="625,3375" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
It feels like not even a minute has passed before you feel a hand on your shoulder gently shaking you awake. You turn and see Orante, her hair almost looking like liquid silver in the moonlight.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  	“It is time for your watch, &lt;name&gt;.” she says quietly before exiting your tent, presumably to go to her own. 
	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
As you rub the sleep from your eyes, you grab your guardian gear and move to the stump Brutus had been sitting on, the light from the dying embers almost insubstantial in this darkness. You don’t know how long you have been watching for before you hear someone clear their throat, close to you. You instantly jump to your feet grasping your scepter tightly, ready to awaken the others before you feel a hand on your [[shoulder.]]

“Relax, it’s just me,” Incertus’s familiarly raspy voice whispers. He slinks out of the shadows and sits on the ground next to the stump. Staring into the fire, a sack by his side. After what feels like years of silence, he speaks again. 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
“I am sorry for avoiding your questions all this time. I know you are merely curious.” You turn to look at him, but he is still [[staring into the fire]].

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
With that, Incertus goes silent. When you turn to look at him, he is gone, an oddly lumpy sack slumped where he once sat. Curious, you [[peek inside the sack]].
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="107" name="staring into the fire" tags="" position="749,3519" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;

You strain to see Incertus’s expression in what little light the embers provide, but his face is nigh unreadable. 
“It takes a certain sort of strength to be honest, not only to yourself but to others. It may not always feel like courage or strength. In fact, at times it may feel like weakness. Trust me when I say it is not. Never feel shame. Never feel the way...the way…”
He suddenly breaks off there and [[looks away.]]

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div hidden class=&quot;mage&quot;&gt; You let out a gasp; a tome, marked with ancient runes, sits within the sack. You can feel the power radiating off of it as you gingerly reach in and pull it out. The pages are already dog-eared and marked, but as you flip through, you feel magic flowing through you, just begging to be released. Eager to try, but not wanting to wake your companions, you [[put the tome back in the sack-&gt;put it back in the sack]].
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div hidden class=&quot;rogue&quot;&gt; Your brow furrows; the sack contains...a bundle of cloth. As you gingerly pull it out, it unrolls and several objects clatter to the ground. As you go to retrieve them, your heart swells. You recognize the two small metal objects as daggers, just like the ones Incertus uses. The other objects you now see are glass vials, attached to a bandolier. You quickly wrap everything back up and [[put them back in the sack-&gt;put it back in the sack]].

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
“Eventful watch, &lt;%=s.NAME %&gt;?” he asks, walking up to you. “I’ll take it from here. Go get some more rest.” 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
You oblige, quickly grabbing the sack and going into your tent, gingerly setting the sack down before lying down to fall asleep once more. This time, a new feeling fills you, one of hope and acceptance, as you drift off to sleep [[once more]].
&lt;/div&gt;

{campbg.png}</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="111" name="once more" tags="" position="1495,308" size="100,100">You are eventually awoken by the bellowing voice of Brutus informing your party that it is time to move out. As you all pack up your tents and provisions, you remember the sack that Incertus gave you. You decide to keep it close, just in case. With camp broken down and everything packed up, your party begins trekking through the Dark Forest, on your way to [[Ye Olde Evil’s lair.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="112" name="Ye Olde Evil’s lair." tags="" position="1495,458" size="100,100">After a few hours of walking through the forest, the trees begin to press closer, and the dirt path that you were traveling along turns into stone. Brutus loosens his sword as the trees press closer and closer until it seems like they will swallow your party. Eventually, the trees clear away into a [stone courtyard] of some sort leading up to the gates of a [large castle]. As you walk up to the doors, they slowly swing open upon creaky hinges to reveal a large, [[mostly empty foyer]].

You can see the filthiness of the floor as you continue walking towards the stairs on the other end. Your gaze drifts along the floor until, at the base of the stairs, you see a faint shape that appears to be moving. As you see it, Orante’s light washes over it and you can now clearly see that it is four adventurers, bound and gagged. Brutus is the first to begin running over to them, with the rest of your party, including you, quickly following suit. As you approach them, you can see they’re clad in similar gear to your party: a knight, a mage, a rogue, and a guardian. Once you get to them, Brutus quickly removes his sword from his sheath and gently cuts the ropes binding them, while the rest of you remove their [[gags.]]&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="114" name="stone courtyard" tags="" position="1643,472" size="100,100">The courtyard isn’t much, with just a few stone walkways around an area of dead grass, with a dry fountain in the center, choked by weeds, and empty of water for who-knows-how-long.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="115" name="large castle" tags="" position="1778,466" size="100,100">A rather intimidating castle made out of dark grey stone with vines creeping up it’s side.

&lt;div&gt;
After they are freed and give thanks, Brutus speaks up. “Alright, it’s not that far to get out of here. Just follow the path and you’ll be able to get out. Good luck.” With that, Brutus pats the knight on the shoulder and they begin running out of the castle. Orante turns to Brutus, a [[curious expression on her face.]]&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="117" name="curious expression on her face." tags="" position="1495,908" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
“What did you do that for, Brutus? Our quest is to return them to Cysa,” she protests, crossing her arms.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus looks at her, something between pleading and hunger on his face.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
“Orante, this is our chance! We could defeat Ye Olde Evil! Ourselves! Can you imagine? We’d be famous heroes!” 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	“No, Brutus. We had our quest. We cannot abandon it and pander to your ridiculous insecurities! We are in no way prepared to fight Ye Olde Evil—especially with &lt;%=s.NAME %&gt;—”
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
As soon as those words leave her mouth, the doors slam shut, the braziers along the walls suddenly bursting into flame. Despite the newfound light, the center of the room still has a circular shadow as dark as night. A voice suddenly speaks, sending chills down your spine.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	“Well, hello, young adventurers. Is someone trying to be a hero? A paltry quest doomed to fail, I’m afraid.” 
The pool of shadow begins to build, swirling slowly in a [[circle.]]

	A nasty vein pulses at Brutus’s temple. The shadows laugh.
“I shall take great pleasure in destroying you and your foolish pride.” 
The shadow begins swirling faster, growing larger and larger, forming itself into the shape of a man.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
“And you, little knight—I shall savour your defeat most of all.”
With a roar, Brutus charges ahead, [[ready for a fight.]]&lt;/div&gt;

Orante uses her Wind Gust to try and blow the figure away, but this merely removes the smoke, leaving [Ye Olde Evil] standing in its place.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
He brings his hand up in a mighty fist and brings it crashing down. Your party scatters as the fist smashes the stone, sending cracks splintering through it. Brutus draws his sword and Incertus sinks into the shadows. What will you do?&lt;br&gt;

Once they’ve all taken their positions, they charge. 
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Brutus surges forward with a mighty bellow. As Ye Olde Evil reaches down to grab him, Brutus uses his Slash, slicing through Ye Olde Evil’s palm. Instead of blood, however, a thick, black liquid seeps out of the wound. 
Orante takes this moment to use Freeze, her hands working to make the symbols required. A layer of frost does manage to settle upon Ye Olde Evil, encasing him in a thin layer of ice. However, it begins to crack almost immediately.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
Incertus takes advantage of this opportunity, using Bleed as he jumps up and slashes Ye Olde Evil’s calves with both of his daggers, quickly retreating into the shadows as more of the black liquid spurts out.&lt;br&gt;

Unfortunately the light backfires, shining into the eyes of your allies, blinding them. They wail in protest as you try to smother the light under your tunic.

“What are you doing?” he bellows, his face turning red. Ye Olde Evil laughs as it [[begins to move towards you.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="126" name="Use Bolster Damage" tags="" position="1785,1655" size="100,100">You raise your scepter high into the air, hoping to bolster your party’s attack power to defeat Ye Olde Evil quicker. As you do so, you look at Orante, who has a flame burning in her hand. As soon as you finish channelling your power, the flame goes out, only to be reignited with some serious effort on her part. She glares at you, a very angry look on her face.

The ice shell around Ye Olde Evil cracks and shatters as it begins moving towards your group. Looking for a target, its gaze falls onto Brutus as it opens its mouth and lets out a white-hot blast of fire. Brutus raises his kite shield to try and absorb the blast, but it pushes past, burning him with a bit of fire. He falls over, sword slipping from his grasp, still breathing, but barely. Your remaining party members scream his name at the same time, Incertus’s voice going back to its normal pitch. 
In anger, Orante prepares a new spell while Incertus sinks back into the shadows. Orante lets out a yell as she places her hand on the stone floor and casts Earthquake.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	The castle begins to shake and rumble as Orante’s magic weaves its way through it, shaking the ground and sending cracks racing towards Ye Olde Evil, throwing him off balance as he lands on his hands and knees. 
Like a flash, Incertus emerges from the shadows and rips his daggers across Ye Olde Evil’s throats in a flash of black blood, before stepping backwards as it grabs its throat. Orante lets out a cheer as it feels like some damage has been done. However, her Earthquake spell continues, and loosens a chunk of stone from the ceiling. It crashes down on her head. She slumps to the ground, unconscious. What do you do?

Your heart pounds, sweat pouring down the sides of your face and pooling in your gauntlets. If you are successful, you will heal Brutus and Orante. If you are successful, you will have saved everyone and salvaged everything, overwriting every mistake you’ve ever made, every impotent spell and useless buff. If you are successful...they will finally accept you. They will all finally accept you. You will [[finally be one of them. ]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="129" name="finally be one of them. " tags="" position="1450,2100" size="100,100">You finish the incantation with a triumphant shout. You can feel the power building in the
scepter, the force gathering in your hands. You direct this magic towards Orante and Brutus. It seems to rip free of you—and suddenly you are left feeling empty and spent. You have exhausted a guardian’s last but most powerful resort.&lt;br&gt;
	[[And nothing happens. ]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="130" name="And nothing happens. " tags="" position="1450,2250" size="100,100">Instead, Incertus gives you a look. At first, his expression is simply confused. But as the spell works its magic on him, it changes. The blood begins to drain from his face and his daggers drop from his hands. His eyes lock with yours in a look of pure sadness and understanding before they roll up into the back of his head and he collapses onto the ground. Seeing this, Ye Olde Evil rears back and lets out a [[bellow of triumph.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="131" name="bellow of triumph." tags="" position="1457,2368" size="100,100">Ye Olde Evil scoops your party members up in one hand before walking over to you and grabbing you in its other. “Foolish little guardian.” It lays extra stress on that word. “You couldn’t have done anything to save them, and you made it impossible for them to win. You are the cause of this.”
&lt;br&gt;
He walks over to the door, pushing it open and throwing you and your party members out into the courtyard, before the door closes with an [[echoing boom.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="132" name="yours." tags="" position="1450,2625" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
“Do you have any idea what you’ve done &lt;%=s.NAME %&gt;? You nearly killed us all! You’re not cut out to be a member of our party! You’re not cut out to be a guardian! You’re not cut out to be an adventurer!”
Those last words ring in your ears, as if Brutus had punched you rather than yelled. You look towards Orante and Incertus, in hopes that they may cool Brutus’s temper. Orante just looks at you coldly, rubbing the back of her head. Incertus gives you a disappointed look, but makes no other comment.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	“Now here’s what’s gonna happen. We’re gonna go back to Cysa, claim the reward for our quest, and tell the Guild that we need a new guardian, seeing as we left ours because they were completely incompetent!” 
Brutus roars those words in your face before bringing himself back up to his full height, turning his back on you, and walking away. Orante and Incertus follow. The rogue is the only one to look back before they walk back to Cysa, leaving you alone at the site of [[your own failure.-&gt;end]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="133" name="echoing boom." tags="" position="1450,2500" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
You quickly dig through the packs of your party members, hoping to find something, anything. Eventually, you manage to find three small health potions. You quickly give it to your party members, hoping it works. After a few moments, they open their eyes, dazed and confused. Brutus is the first to get to his feet. He lets out a roar of anger and punches a tree so hard the wood cracks and splinters. He whips around to face you, his face a few inches from [[yours.]]

It opens its mouth before shooting a jet of white-hot fire at you.  Before it can hit you, however, Brutus charges up to you, locking shields with you.  The fire washes off your shields and dies off, leaving you both hot, but alive.  Brutus looks at you with a gleam in his eye.  “Can’t let you die yet, can I?”  He chuckles.  “I’ve got a plan.  Trust me.”  Orante whips her hands around as she casts Frost once more on Ye Olde Evil, encasing him in a thicker layer of ice than before.  Incertus uses Smoke Powder, taking a jar from his belt and throwing it at Ye Olde Evil’s feet, causing black smoke to rise up.  What will you do?

He instead crouches and raises his shield at an angle.  “Run at me, youngin’!”  You hesitate before charging towards Brutus as fast as your legs can carry you.  As you reach him, you run up onto his shield and, with a mighty roar, Brutus pushes up as hard as he can, sending you flying into the air.  As you reach the peak of your jump, you instinctively lash out with your sword, stabbing it deep into the mass of shadowy flesh in front of you.  Your sword sinks all the way to the hilt.  A bellow of pain fills your ears as your weight causes you to start sliding down, along with the sword, cutting a large slash from neck to navel in Ye Olde Evil’s body.  As you hit the ground, you and Brutus quickly move out of the way as the towering mass of evil falls forward, smashing into the ground with an [[earth-shattering thud.]]

Before you can stare at it for too long though, it dissolves into smoke, vaporizing and drifting away.  Yet despite the happiness that this victory should bring, their is a looming issue not being addressed.  Once your party exits the castle and enters the courtyard, Brutus brings the matter up.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“&lt;%= s.NAME %&gt;, what was that back there?  You weren’t using guardian skills again.”  He begins.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“I’m not a guardian.” You respond.  You can’t keep it in any longer.  “It’s what I’ve been trying to tell you.  I’m not a guardian, and I’ve never wanted to be a guardian.  I’ve always wanted to be a &lt;%= s.ROLE.toLowerCase() %&gt;,”  You look at them expectantly, [[waiting for backlash.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="143" name="Use Fireball" tags="" position="2225,1900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	You flip through the book of magic, the pages coming to life in your hands.  You find the proper spell and begin twisting your fingers into the necessary motions.  A small ball of fire appears in your hand and you stare at it in wonder for a few moments before aiming at Ye Olde Evil and lobbing the fireball at it.  The flames splash over it, licking and burning for a few moments before going out.  Ye Olde Evil turns and [[lumbers towards you-&gt;lumbering towards you.]] angry at this new development.
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="144" name="Use Freeze" tags="" position="2350,1900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	You flip through the book of magic, the pages coming to life in your hands.  You find the proper spell and begin twisting your fingers into the necessary motions. As you finish your spell, a layer of frost begins building over Ye Olde Evil. It quickly grows, covering the being in about an inch of solid ice.  However, it is too poweful and manages to shatter the ice before turning and [[lumbering towards you.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="145" name="Use Wind Gust" tags="" position="2475,1900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	You flip through the book of magic, the pages coming to life in your hands.  You find the proper spell and begin twisting your fingers into the necessary motions. As you finish your incantation, you push your hand towards Ye Olde Evil.  A powerful gust of wind howls against it, causing him to force himself to stay in the same position.  Unfortunately, that’s as much effect as it could have.  Ye Olde Evil then begins [[lumbering towards you.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="146" name="Use Chain Lightning" tags="" position="2600,1900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	You flip through the book of magic, the pages coming to life in your hands.  You find the proper spell and begin twisting your fingers into the necessary motions. As you finish the motions, a bolt of lightning shoots out of your hand and strikes Ye Olde Evil right in the chest, rippling along its entire body.  It howls in pain before setting its sights on you, [[lumbering towards you.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="147" name="Use Earthquake" tags="" position="2725,1900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	You flip through the book of magic, the pages coming to life in your hands.  You find the proper spell and begin twisting your fingers into the necessary motions. You place your hand on the ground and send the magical energy racing through the ground, causing the entire floor of the mansion to begin rumbling.  Ye Olde Evil falls over, hitting the ground with a thud, but manages to get back up and begins [[lumbering towards you.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="148" name="lumbering towards you." tags="" position="2225,2025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	Ye Olde Evil lumbers towards you, it’s gaze fixed on this new target.  It opens its mouth before shooting a jet of white-hot fire at you.  Before it can hit you, however, Orante uses Wind Gust, blasting the fire with wind, slowing it a bit.  You quickly follow suit, and you both manage to keep the flames at bay with your wind until Ye Olde Evil runs out of breath.  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“&lt;%= s.NAME %&gt;, prepare a fire spell.”  Orante says, looking at you meaningfully.  “I have a plan to defeat this being once and for all.”  What will you do?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	[[Use Burning Frost]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="149" name="Use Burning Frost" tags="" position="2225,2150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	As you gather fire within your palm, you see Orante doing the same with frost.  She looks at you and nods. “Now!” she cries.  You both send your spells surging forward, striking Ye Olde Evil in the chest with a mixture of alternating cold and heat, fire and ice.  The combined magic eventually just becomes too much for him as his body begins steaming, before falling to the ground with an [[earth-shattering thud.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="150" name="Use Up and Over" tags="" position="2225,2300" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	Incertus darts out from the shadows, until he gets just behind Ye Olde Evil, he turns to you and gets down on one knee, forming a little platform with his hands.  He gestures for you to come on, and you quickly unsheath your daggers and dart towards him from out of the shadows.  You step into the platform of his hands and push off just as he pushes you upward.  You go flying up, instinctively plunging your daggers into the mass of shadowy flesh in front of you.  As you plunge them in, your weight causes you to drag them down, creating two huge gouges of flesh to be carved out of Ye Olde Evil’s back.  As you land, you and Incertus both use Dodge as Ye Olde Evil’s corpse no falls to the ground with an [[earth-shattering thud.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="151" name="waiting for backlash." tags="" position="2225,2575" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	“Well then we still have a problem, &lt;%= s.NAME %&gt;, because our party needs four people, and one of them needs to be a guardian, so either accept it, or leave.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Incertus moves to stand by your side, keeping his hood up.  “If &lt;%= s.NAME %&gt; leaves, so do I.  They’re like me, just in a different way.  They deserve to be the role they are, not the role they’re given.” He says, keeping a hand firmly [[on your shoulder.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="152" name="on your shoulder." tags="" position="2225,2700" size="100,100">&lt;div hidden class=&quot;knight&quot;&gt;	“Besides, Brutus, wouldn’t you like to be able to do more of those vicious attacks in combat?  How are you going to do them without another knight?”
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div hidden class=&quot;mage&quot;&gt;	“Besides, Orante, wouldn’t you like to weave magic into more powerful attacks?  How are you going to do that without another mage?”
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	You begin to tear up slightly at Incertus’s standing up for you.  You still aren’t sure about their decision though, as Brutus walks up and looks down at you.  Then, unexpectantly, he grabs you and lifts you off the ground in a spine-shattering bearhug.  “Guardian or not, you’re part of the team.  Besides, you work a lot better as a &lt;%=s.ROLE %&gt; then a guardian.” He sets you down and Orante rests her hand on your shoulder.  “Agreed.  From now on, please stay away from using guardian skills.”  As you all laugh, you begin to head back towards Cysa, with a new tale to tell.  And for once, you feel like you’re [[finally heading home.-&gt;end]]
