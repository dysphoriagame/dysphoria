	Like so many other aspiring adventurers, you find yourself newly-arrived in the Adventurers’ Guild hall, nearly lost in the sea of recruits spilling in through the doors. The guild hall bristles with activity, the air taut with urgency. Guildmates bustle wild-eyed newcomers into whatever gear is on hand, veteran adventurers shouting over the din— “Our party needs another ranger, find us a ranger why don’t you!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Our party has an opening for a knight!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Where is our guardian? Ye Olde Evil’s minions will attack any moment now!”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Register for the guild and join an adventuring party here!” a narrow-faced guild master calls, standing on a table and waving a handful of scrolls. Pulled along by the jostling chaos, you end up at the front of the line. The guild member [[peers down at you.]]

	Surely this is some sort of mistake? It has to be. You thought you were allowed to choose your own role. Is that not how it usually goes? You journey to a new and fantastical realm, you declare your role, and then you join a party and you all go on grand adventures together—is that not how it usually works? Is that not how the [[stories always go?]]

	“Lucky for you, younglin’, we had some spare guardian gear lyin’ around. Save you a trip to the smithy. It ought to fit, more or less.” Brutus grabs a long robe, a buckler, and a scepter from under the table and drops them into your arms. They are hardly heavy, and yet you nearly stumble beneath the sudden weight, more out of shock than anything else. You stare at the bundle in your arms. He simply gave you a guardian’s gear? You weren’t even allowed a choice? 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“You can buy better gear once you have the gold for it. For now, this will do,” Brutus continues.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You try to nod and smile—he is, after all, only trying to be helpful—but in the back of your mind, you are already plotting to exchange this coarse robe and useless scepter for a proper &lt;%= s.ROLE.toLowerCase() %&gt;’s set of gear.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Suddenly, a loud horn blares [[through the hall.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="through the hall." tags="" position="25,1025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“And that there is our cue,” Brutus says, grabbing his own sword and shield. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	All around you, parties of adventurers hastily don their gear and begin flooding out of the hall, the deep bellows of the horn echoing off wall and ceiling. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Our cue for what?” you ask as Orante helps you into your robe and fastens your buckler to your arm. The small, round shield grips your forearm, vise-like. The robe is coarse and far too large. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus bares his fangs in a wide grin, dark pupils flaring.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Ye Olde Evil’s minions are swarmin’ the beaches just outside of Cysa. Our first quest is to clear them out and defend the city. Now hurry along, no more time for explainin’!”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Before you know it, you are being dragged to the outskirts of the city, embarking on your first adventure not as a &lt;%=s.ROLE.toLowerCase()%&gt;, but [[as a guardian.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="as a guardian." tags="" position="25,1150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	The ocean of adventurers splits upon leaving the guild hall. Half of the parties charge to the drawbridge, prepared to defend against the trolls lurching towards the city gates. Your half hurries to the beaches beyond Cysa’s walls, where [goblins] are swarming out of makeshift rafts and vessels. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You do your best to keep up with your party, nearly tripping over the hem of your robe, almost tumbling down the crudely hewn stairs that lead down to the beach. The roar of the sea grows deafeningly loud, no longer dampened by city walls, as your party spills out across the blinding white sands.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“There!” Brutus shouts, pointing at a nearby cluster of goblins. The creatures bare their fangs and hiss. “A little somethin’ to warm us up!” 
You hurry after your party as they [[charge.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="charge." tags="" position="28,1258" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus is first into the fray, using his Slash to cleave through the nearest goblin, blood spraying in the wake of his sword. The orc knight gives a triumphant roar, wading further into combat. &lt;if knight&gt; You watch him enviously, imagining what it would be like, to be able to charge into danger so boldly, to be able to wield the brutal power of a sword—to wield anything other than your stupid scepter. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante casts Fireball and hurls the resultant orb of flame at another goblin. The creature shrieks as its cloth armor catches fire, and it flees towards the water. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Incertus slips around the enemies, unnoticed, and plunges his daggers into a goblin archer in the back. He disengages, tugging at the collar of his tunic.

Brutus frowns, clearly not feeling nearly as invigorated as he had hoped. You give him a half-hearted shrug and a weak smile in reply. He grunts and charges back into the thick of battle.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante coughs delicately.

	Brutus uses Shield Bash, violently slamming his kite shield forward. It connects with a goblin’s face, sending the creature flying, dazed, bone and cartilage collapsed by this brutish assault. The last goblin standing shrieks in alarm and begins to scramble away.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante whispers an incantation and twists her fingers above her tome. Ice settles over the fleeing goblin, freezing it in place.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Incertus moves so swiftly, she almost seems to teleport to the frozen goblin, her daggers sliding between its ribs before the creature even has time to react. She steps away as Orante’s Freeze swallows up the rest of its body, leaving an ice statue stained by two [[blooms of crimson.]] 
&lt;div hidden class=&quot;rogue&quot;&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	“What filthy creatures need to be put down next?” he roars. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	A poorly built raft crashes onto the beach nearby, throwing four goblins—two warriors, an archer, and a shaman—free of the thrashing waves. Brutus gives a rumbling bellow and [[rushes towards them.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;

	Brutus swings his mighty sword at the goblin with a snarl. However, the goblin dances out of the way of the heavy Slash, jeering. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Lucky,” Brutus spits.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Weak,” the goblin sneers, slicing Brutus across the upper arm. The orc knight’s eyes nearly bulge from his head.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante hastily spins another Freeze out of thin air, encasing the offending foe in ice. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Incertus flings a vial from her bandolier at the goblins’ feet. The glass shatters against a rock, and noxious gases rise in a green cloud, poisoning the foes. They cough and gasp, clutching their throats, scurrying away from the fumes.

&lt;div&gt;
	“A heal, younglin’! I need a heal” Brutus shouts, clutching his arm.

You grit your teeth; now you really want to throw your scepter through its head. Or, better yet, use &lt;%= s.ROLE.toLowerCase() %&gt;’s gear to slay it like a proper &lt;%= s.ROLE.toLowerCase() %&gt;, instead of trying to make do with this nonsense!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus hefts his shield, spitting on the frozen goblin warrior before advancing [[on the second.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

	“I did not require aid,” Orante murmurs.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The goblin archer lets loose an arrow. It grazes Orante’s shoulder, leaving a thin line of blood in its wake. Your Mend slowly closes the small wound, restoring her pale skin. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Preemptive healing?” you suggest.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	She purses her lips, giving you a highly skeptical look.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus hefts his shield, spitting on the frozen goblin warrior before advancing [[on the second.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="on the second." tags="" position="25,2275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	The second goblin warrior’s taunts are cut short after it takes a mouthful of Brutus’s shield.
The goblin shaman gives one last squeak and keels over, overcome by the poison. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante conjures up a swirling sphere of fire and hurls it at the goblin archer. The nimble archer dances backwards to avoid it—and dodges right into Incertus’s waiting blades. After the body drops, she hastily bends over not the body, but the weapon it once carried. You frown. You look around, but no one else seems to have noticed the rogue’s antics.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Another victory,” Orante hums happily. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Not quite,” Brutus growls, gripping his sword as he storms towards the [[frozen goblin warrior.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="frozen goblin warrior." tags="" position="33,2401" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	Orante inhales sharply, aware of Brutus’s intentions before anyone else. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Surely that is not necessary—” she begins—but is cut off by the first swing of Brutus’s blade. One ice-encrusted goblin arm falls to the ground, chopped off by the orc knight.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“No one,” he rumbles, hacking at the other arm, “no one calls me weak and lives to tell the tale.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	With a final grunt of effort, he lops the goblin’s head off, the creature’s face trapped in a permanent sneer as it [[rolls down the beach.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;
	</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="You slowly turn." tags="" position="25,2650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	“Ah. A [troll],” Orante observes. “Must have escaped the fight at the gates.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The lumbering creature stomps across the beach, an earthshattering bellow breaking free of its malformed face as it carelessly knocks adventurer after adventurer aside. Ranger arrows and mage spells bounce harmlessly off the calcified leather of its flesh, and its massive club—fashioned from an uprooted tree, by the looks of it—sweeps entire parties out of its way. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Finally! A challenge!” Brutus says.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Your party moves towards the troll as it flattens another adventuring party. You hurry along behind them, clutching your robes so you [[do not trip.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="do not trip." tags="" position="25,2775" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	Brutus reaches the troll first, slashing at the thick folds of flesh pillowing around its legs. His sword apparently slices something vital, for the troll stumbles and falls on one knee with a startled cry—but not before smashing its club into Brutus and sending the orc knight flying. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante casts Fireball. The orb of flame splashes across the troll’s flattened face, lighting the sparse hairs on its scalp on fire. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The troll paws at the new pain on its head in confusion, absentmindedly swinging its club, the crude weapon’s blunt end nearly hitting Incertus and Orante. The rogue hastily uses Dodge; she almost seems to recede into her own shadow, shrinking back and avoiding all harm. Orante, on the other hand, does not avoid any harm at all—rather, she is flung several feet backwards, her tome tumbling from her grasp.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	[[It is your turn to act.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="It is your turn to act." tags="" position="25,2900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	[[You could use Blind.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

	You try to summon what concentration you have left, doing your best to stifle the doubting clamor at the back of your mind. You direct your scepter towards Brutus, channeling Mend. He gives a violent cough and manages to struggle back onto his feet, sword and shield in hand. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Did I help?” you ask.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	He coughs again.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Yes! Of course, younglin’!” he shouts back, but the way he gingerly touches his ribs [[suggests otherwise.]]

	You try to summon what concentration you have left, doing your best to stifle the doubting clamor at the back of your mind. You direct your scepter towards the troll, channeling Blind. A dull glow emanates from the end of your scepter. The troll stares dumbly at it, hardly blinded, but certainly mesmerized by the little flickering light.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	 Brutus gives a violent cough and manages to struggle back onto his feet, sword and shield in hand. He gives your scepter a decidedly unimpressed look.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Ah, yes, just…keep doin’ that, recruit, keep him distracted,” the orc knight shouts.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	His yelling snaps the troll out of its hypnosis. With an incensed roar, it charges at your party [[once more.-&gt;suggests otherwise.]]

	You charge the troll, raising your buckler as if it is a kite shield, brandishing your scepter as if it is a sword. Brutus gives a startled yell.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“What are you doin’, recruit?!” 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You ignore him and continue running forward. The troll gives a heaving roar and swings its club at you. You stumble out of the way just in time, sand spraying around you as the club smashes into the ground. Seeing your opening in the troll’s sluggish reflexes and slow recovery, you smash the knobbed end of your scepter against its fingers. There is a crack, a deafening grunt of pain—and then the troll reels backwards, nursing its broken hand, [[club forgotten.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div hidden class=&quot;mage&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
	“What are you doin’, recruit?!”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You ignore him and flip to a dogeared page, hands already moving through the air in complex patterns, lips already moving in the shapes of incantations. You slip into the role of mage with utmost ease—and, for the first time since you embarked on this adventure, you feel completely comfortable and entirely capable.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	A thick shell of ice winds up the troll’s legs, fixing it to the ground. It gives an incensed roar, struggling against its sudden bonds, but [[it cannot move.-&gt;club forgotten.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div hidden class=&quot;rogue&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

	“What are you doin’, recruit?!”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
   	You ignore him and hurl your buckler at the troll. The round, wooden shield smashes into its nose with a soft crunch; the troll lurches backwards, clutching at its face in pain. Taking advantage of this distraction, you run behind the troll and begin clambering up its back, using the tufts of hair sprouting from its hardened skin as handholds until your feet are planted on its shoulders. You take your scepter and plunge its sharper end into the troll’s eye.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The massive creature gives a wail of pain and shudders to its knees, pitching you off its shoulders and [[into the sand.-&gt;club forgotten.]]

	Brutus charges towards the troll once more as Incertus circles behind the massive creature. As the knight distracts the troll with his glancing sword blows and clanging shield, the rogue runs up the misshapen monster’s back, nimble and noiseless. Before the troll can even realize there is an unwanted guest standing on its shoulders, Incertus slices its throat.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	It stands there for a moment, swaying, too dumb to register its own demise. It gives one last groan, and then finally collapses in a spray of sand, Incertus gracefully leaping clear. The final foe on the beach has been felled by a stunning display of teamwork and skill—and you? You could only watch uselessly.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Congratulations on finishin’ your first adventure in one piece!” he laughs. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You try to smile, try to laugh and celebrate with the other adventurers as you all return to the city, but the victory feels empty. [[You feel hollow.]]

However, it does not take them long to recognize the opening you have just given them, and they hastily surge forward to aid you. As the troll reels with pain, Brutus charges it from the front, and Incertus circles around to its rear. While the knight lays blow after blow upon its tough hide, the rogue runs up the misshapen monster’s back, nimble and noiseless. Before the troll can even realize there is an unwanted guest standing on its shoulders, Incertus [[slices its throat.]]

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“That was…quite somethin’, younglin’. I have never quite seen anythin’ like it, but…” He pauses, his look of confusion only growing. “But good on you for your quick thinkin’. And congratulations on finishin’ your first adventure in one piece.” 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

	You feel exhilarated, your triumphs on the beach rekindling the embers of your once-fading eagerness. You walk with a bit of a spring in your step, shoulders back, head held high. As you stride into the guild hall, you have half a mind to boast loudly to the nearest adventurer you can find. This is how you always imagined it would feel—to return, victorious and proud, after a hard day of [[fighting and adventuring.]]

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You know you should feel triumphant, a veritable champion returning from a day of grueling combat and successful adventuring, and yet…the feelings are empty. Hollowed out by the heavy scepter you carry in your hand. Dampened by the buckler strapped to your arm. The quest was a success. You defeated the minions of Ye Olde Evil and successfully defended the city. So why does it feel as if you are the one who lost in the end?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

	You briefly consider retreating back into the closet and hiding under the nearest pile of clothes.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“My apologies. My Mends and Blinds did not work very well, did they,” you mutter sheepishly. A small thought squirms in the back of your mind: “You wouldn’t be apologizing if you were a &lt;%= s.ROLE %&gt;, now would you?” You grind your teeth in [[frustration.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="frustration." tags="" position="650,275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt; “It was your first real adventure. Some recruits struggle a bit in the beginnin’,” Brutus says kindly.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“You’ll do better on the next quest, right, younglin’?” Brutus asks. His face is smiling, but his eyes—pinprick pupils against blistering green—are intense and unblinking. You can feel Orante’s cool gaze on you as well. The room suddenly feels too hot and small, the air itself stifled by the pressure.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

	“Good, good. That’s what we want to hear, younglin’,” he rumbles. “We need a dependable guardian to support us if we ever want to defeat Ye Olde Evil. And you do want to help us defeat Ye Olde Evil, yes? Of course you do.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	He looks as if he’s about to continue, but Orante smoothly cuts him off.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“&lt;Name&gt;, why don’t you go to the marketplace and spend your well-deserved gold?” she says gently. “Brutus and I have plans to discuss—and where is Incertus?” You hadn’t even noticed that the rogue had disappeared.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Sure. I’ll be back later,” you say.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You glance over your shoulder as you leave. Brutus and Orante are huddled over the table in the middle of the room, their backs to you. You feel oddly alone in that moment, excluded from whatever world they are allowed to participate in. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Ah, ha, a hilarious jest,” he guffaws. It sounds painfully forced. “Never mind that. I have full faith in you, younglin’. We do need a guardian—you know that, yes?

&lt;div&gt;	The apothecary shop would have been a decent-sized shop, if not for the clutter. The shelves seem to lean forward precariously, each level in danger of spilling its precious cargo of containers. Jars, bottles, vials, pails, pans, pots, and upturned helms have all been employed to carry some sort of powder or liquid or dried animal part. Crates crowd the floor, each filled beyond their brims with leathered hides, exotic flora, and assorted bones. Piles of books vie for space amidst the mess. Strange creatures squawk and screech from cages hanging overhead.

	The smithy greets you with a blast of hot air and the rhythmic din of metal upon metal. The forge is stained by a hundred vermillion hues, the stone walls colourless without the violent flashes of fire and brilliant sprays of sparks. The furnace flares and growls in the back, illuminating the apprentices working at the anvils. Weapons and armors hang in rows against the walls, some sorely in need of repair, some polished and gleaming. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The [blacksmith] moves to the counter, wiping his hands off on his apron.

&lt;div&gt;
	You fumble around in your satchel, fingers eventually finding the scroll at the bottom of the bag. You numbly hand it over to the blacksmith. The burly dwarf opens it, occasionally glancing at you over the top of the paper. You feel your cheeks flush. You had planned on buying &lt;role&gt; gear; seems your plans have been foiled.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“A guardian, eh?” He returns the scroll and turns to rummage through a nearby rack of gear. “I have just the thing. A sturdy robe, with protective lining to defend against blade and arrow alike, and charmed cloth to ward against magical spells. A staff, good for channeling guardian skills. And, of course, a buckler, to protect against melee attacks.”

&lt;/div&gt;

In fact, now that you look closer, his hairless face does look a bit feminine…

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div hidden id=&quot;Other&quot;&gt;
	If I’d used rogue, mage, or, god forbid, *ranger* skills, my party would’ve had my head.” She slaps a gauntleted fist against her breastplate. “Luckily, being a knight fitted me like a custom-made suit of plate.” 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	She chuckles as she pulls out a scroll of parchment wrapped in red ribbon and sealed with the guild’s emblem in a [[deep blue wax]].
&lt;/div&gt;

%&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="80" name="deep blue wax" tags="" position="650,2150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	“Here. Special orders from the Guild Master,” she says as she passes you the scroll.  “Some dumbarse party managed to find Ye Olde Evil’s lair in the [Dark Forest] and decided to go chargin’ in there, tryin’ to be heroes. Haven’t heard back from them in a few days.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You take the scroll hesitantly as she continues.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Your quest is to go track them down and bring them back. Preferably in one piece. The scroll contains a map to the Dark Forest, as well as details of your payment. Good luck.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	With that, she turns around and begins walking away, armor clanking slightly with [[every step.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="81" name="every step." tags="" position="650,2275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	As you turn away from the door and begin to shut it, a mighty hand stops it from closing.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “Glad to see you’re finally awake &lt;%= s.NAME %&gt;,” Brutus rumbles, seeming to have been restored to his jovial self.  “First adventure often takes a lot out of you. Good to see you’re up and about.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Despite seeming like his normal self, it feels as if there’s something off.  It is almost as if he is trying a little too hard to be positive and upbeat.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “What’cha got there?” he asks, gesturing to the scroll clenched tightly in your fist.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “Oh, this? A dwarf knight dropped it off. She said it was from the Guild Master.”  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You hold it out to Brutus, who quickly takes it from your grasp.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “Sounds like Audent. Feisty one, she is. During the defense of the city, she cut off three goblin heads with one swing of her sword.”  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	As he talks about her and breaks the wax seal on the scroll, you swear you hear a tone of admiration in his voice, along with something else you can’t quite put your finger on.  Brutus, ignorant of your analysis of him, unrolls the scroll and begins reading [[to himself.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="82" name="Dark Forest" tags="" position="775,2150" size="100,100">A densely wooded area about a day’s travel from Cysa. Known as the center of Ye Olde Evil’s power—perhaps due to the atmosphere the area provides—its name comes from the fact that the foliage is so dense that almost no light makes it through.  The forest is packed with monsters, both wild and in servitude to Ye Olde Evil.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="83" name="to himself." tags="" position="650,2400" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	Brutus’s face goes through several emotions over the course of reading the scroll, from worry, to excitement, to pure joy, to disappointment. He closes the scroll just as Orante and Incertus enter. Incertus is back in his standard outfit, pointedly ignoring your searching gaze.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “What’s that Brutus?” Orante asks, her eyes darting over to you for a second before looking back at him.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “Guild Master gave us a quest.  Rescue a group from Dark Forest. Says nothin’ of fightin’ Ye Olde Evil, though,” Brutus says, a note of disappointment carrying through his voice.  It quickly disappears as he becomes upbeat once more.  “Well, I say there’s no time like the present to get started on a quest!  Get ready, we leave in an hour!” 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	With that Brutus turns and leaves the room, no doubt heading to the blacksmith to pick up some new weaponry.  Orante turns to you, an odd look [[in her eyes.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="84" name="Bring up the encounter with Incertus." tags="" position="775,2650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	As Incertus begins to pack his stuff, you clear your throat, trying to get his attention. He ignores you. Finally, you decide to be straightforward ask him about it.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    “So...about earlier,” you begin. Before you can say any more, he slips out of the room. You sigh and decide to leave the matter alone for now and begin to [[prepare for your trip.-&gt;Prepare for the trip to the Dark Forest.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="85" name="Prepare for the trip to the Dark Forest." tags="" position="650,2650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	You don’t have much to put together for the trip, aside from donning your new equipment. While the new robe fits much better than the last one, it still does not feel right. You pick up your staff and buckler. They feel unwieldy and lifeless in your hands. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You look in the mirror, at that thing dressed in a guardian&#39;s armor staring blankly back. You recognize more in strangers than you do in your reflection. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	With a heavy, chest-hollowing sigh, you assemble the rest of your gear before heading down to [[set out for the Dark Forest.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

	“I shall go and gather some provisions for our journey.  Tis about a day’s travel from here. I suggest making sure that you both have all you need.”  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	She once again glances at you before following Brutus out of the room. What will you do?
&lt;/div&gt;

Brutus turns to the rest of the party, ignoring your startled looks. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Now,” he says triumphantly, “we have our victory.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Incertus makes a soft noise. You start; you have never heard him make any sort of noise, much less speak.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Almost,” he mutters, pointing past you. His voice is oddly raspy, as if he is forcing it to sound deeper than it is. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	And that is when you feel the ground shake beneath you, the air trembling with a deep roar. [[You slowly turn.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="92" name="slices its throat." tags="" position="400,3266" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	It stands there for a moment, swaying, too dumb to register its own demise. It gives one last groan, and then finally collapses in a spray of sand, Incertus gracefully leaping clear. The final foe on the beach has been felled by a stunning display of teamwork and skill—and you? You helped.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You gave your party members the advantage they needed to slay the troll. You feel a surge of triumph fill you as the rest of the adventurers on the beach [[cheer.-&gt;cheer2]]
