And who could forget the ancient foe that plagued the land every several years? The [[stories]] of [[Ye Olde Evil’s]] repeated vanquishing were among your favourites. Now that you have come of age, it is no surprise you’ve chosen to set off for Eorundem, your [[mother’s]] blessing still lingering on your cheek. [[It is time for an adventure.]]

You spend your days with wide, awestruck eyes as the everchanging [[landscape]] rolls languidly by; at night you watch strange constellations chase each other across the sky. Your travels are briefly halted by a stampede of three-headed, fire-breathing buffalo, and two wagons losing their wheels to mischievous gremlins—and for three days straight a deluge of strange rain coats the rivers in fine silver. However, these slight mishaps only further whet your appetite for adventure, and [[your anticipation only grows.]]

The horizon has never seemed so far away before, and nothing—no village huts or crowding trees—breaks the great expanse of blue overhead. In the distance, you can see stone temples carved from the mountain range, glistening with ice. The lush meadows stretch in all directions from the dusty road, their grasses swelling and rolling in the wind, their slopes flecked with flowers. White stags with six pink eyes watch your procession from the safety of the forests, but they scatter when something roars from deep within the woods. [[Back-&gt;It is time for an adventure.]]

	“And, should things…not go the way you thought they…well, if you ever need a friendly ear, I am free to talk over tea,” she adds.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You nod and bid her farewell as she leaves. You linger by the fire for a little while longer, but when the other folk start to drift away, [you decide to return to your wagon.] As you nestle into your cot among the barrels of dried meat, your mind turns to Ana. Her odd change in demeanor confuses you. Did she have a particular dislike for &lt;chosen role&gt;? Perhaps you had been too boastful, too eager—perhaps she doubted your ability to succeed? And yet she seemed so nice…[[surely she wouldn’t…]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="surely she wouldn’t…" tags="" position="25,1275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[…]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You drift into a deep sleep, exhausted by the past weeks of travel, mind too tired to contemplate any more hypotheticals. [[A gentle snoring fills your wagon.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="A gentle snoring fills your wagon." tags="" position="25,1400" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	That night you dream you are running from something. You are not certain what, you do not turn to look—but you can hear it pursuing you. At times it seems to be growling, snarling after you in deep and grating tones. Other times its voice goes soft, like well-worn velvet. And then it goes quiet, and all you can hear are soft footsteps from the surrounding shadows. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You try to run faster, but you are carrying weapons upon weapons—swords, shields, staffs, tomes, daggers, bows—and your shoulders and legs are weighed down by mismatched armor. Just when you can nearly feel the hot breath of your pursuer on your neck and the cold bite of metal, you [[trip]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;
	and the stone itself opens up to swallow you whole

around a [shield]
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;
	[You open your eyes.]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	It is morning. You have arrived at Cysa, city capital of Eorundem, Flower-by-the-Sea.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You gather your belongings and burst out of your wagon, nightmares forgotten, eager to see what you have only dreamed of until [[now.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="now." tags="" position="25,1775" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Marble watchtowers and gilded arches greet your eyes, glittering brilliantly in the rising sun, the festive banners of royal blue and white draped from frosted windows stirring in the wind. When you peer upwards, you can see guards in silver armor and creamy furs pacing along the battlements. Elaborate [[statues]] unfurl from the corbels, shaped of intricate glasswork and masterful stone carving. A well-worn [[drawbridge]] groans beneath your wagon’s wheels as the caravan slowly rolls into the city. [[You can hardly keep yourself from dashing ahead.]]

	As you stride down the wide [[thoroughfare]], dusty boots slapping against the pristine stones underfoot, you notice the citizens of Cysa begin to take interest in the city’s newest additions. A pair of slender elves watch coolly from their balcony, sipping tea and eating thin slices of raw fish. A gaggle of human children run alongside the caravan, giggling and pointing, until they are distracted by a bright blue butterfly and chase it down a side street. A group of dwarves pause their card game to shout greetings, grinning broadly at the parade of newcomers. You get some surly, incurious looks from an orc woman struggling to hang her laundry on one of the many clotheslines that [[swing over alleyways.]]

	You quickly learn why Cysa is known as the Flower-by-the-Sea; the city is designed to mimic a rose and its innumerable folds. Each district is a petal, each road following the intricate pattern of the flower’s irregular whorls. It is the very center of the rose—the close cluster of petals—that holds the marketplace, [[the heart of Cysa.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="swing over alleyways." tags="" position="25,2025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	A bard sitting on a doorstep sings a hastily-composed ode to you and your companions, but frowns and stops when no one tips him. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Overhead, a hanging garden dangles from the marble arches. Baskets overflow with spiraling violet flowers and tumbling cascades of snowy blossoms, the exotic florae showering the caravan with petals in each gust of wind. Colourful birds flit among the green tendrils and bursts of leaves. Above, the sky is a patchwork of vibrant blues and white clouds. You breathe in deeply. The air is refreshingly cool and crusted with sea salt. You shiver—partially from the cold, partially from [[nervous excitement.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="the heart of Cysa." tags="" position="25,2275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	[Your nose knows the marketplace before your eyes do.] Strong spices, roasting meats, pungent fruits, cooking vegetables, salted fish, and baking breads assault that singular sense first. [Next are your ears.] The sound of people laughing and shouting, wagons creaking, animals braying and squawking and barking, foods sizzling, and the distant thunder of the sea overpowers your hearing. [[By the time you enter the marketplace and embrace it with your eyes, you’re already overwhelmed.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="By the time you enter the marketplace and embrace it with your eyes, you’re already overwhelmed." tags="" position="25,2400" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	The merchants’ vending stalls and carts are gathered in the center of the marketplace, a cluster of bright colours, exotic wares, and traders eagerly offering their merchandise to passersby. The caravan quickly dissolves at the sight of this, most of the travelers unhitching their wagons or unfolding their vending stalls, eager to join the cluster of merchants. You catch sight of Ana Ymra unpacking crates filled with jars of purple ooze; you shudder and look away. Gathering your belongings, you leave what is left of the caravan behind and head off in search of the [[Adventurers’ Guild.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Adventurers’ Guild." tags="" position="25,2525" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	The marketplace is exceptionally busy today. Crowds weave in jostling, chattering ribbons through the merchant stalls, winding in and out of the ring of shops along the marketplace’s edge. Smells and sounds wash over you in powerful waves. Your eyes can barely focus on any one thing, much less take in the scene in its entirety. For a moment, you are almost paralyzed by the sheer amount of commotion and noise. You have finally reached the famed city of Cysa after so many years of dreaming and waiting, and for the first time, you can do anything, be anything—yet now that you’re here, you find you can hardly move. [[That is, until someone taps your shoulder.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="That is, until someone taps your shoulder." tags="" position="25,2650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You spin around, wondering if pickpockets are particularly prevalent in Cysa. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Forgive me, I could not help but notice…you look rather lost,” [someone says.]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You take a moment to appraise the hooded person before you. At first glance, the person comes off as rather manly; their frame is stocky and well-muscled, their voice low and a bit gravelly. However, at a closer glance at the softness of their face beneath the cowl—and the shape of their body beneath the robe—you realize that you are, in fact, [[speaking to a woman.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="speaking to a woman." tags="" position="25,2775" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Yes, I am lost. I was looking for the Adventurers’ Guild…?” you answer.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Of course you are.” The woman points at a nearby spire from which a blue pennant flutters. “Simply follow those flags. They will lead you to the Adventurers’ Guild. The guild hall itself is hard to miss.” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Looking up now, you can in fact see a series of pennants curving around the marketplace, leading elsewhere. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Thank you, ma’am,” you say gratefully. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The woman [[seems to flinch, already walking away.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="seems to flinch, already walking away." tags="" position="25,2900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“New adventurers come here often. The citizens of Cysa have grown quite accustomed to giving you lot directions,” she mutters.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You don’t bother dwelling on her strange reaction or rather brusque response; you have a guild hall to find and a party to join. You set off, eyes firmly fixed on the [[trail of banners.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="trail of banners." tags="" position="25,3025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	As you march up the broad, sweeping stairs that lead to the guild hall, you wonder how you could not have seen the structure in question. Unlike the rest of the city, the hall is made of burnished wood, the crest of its roof curving in an arc, the walls bulging outwards before tapering sharply in the back. In fact, the more you marvel at it, the more it looks like a massive ship that has been cut in half and turned upside down in the middle of the city. Its broad oaken doors are flanked by two rippling banners, each bearing the crest of Cysa: sapphire rose against white.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	After steeling yourself and taking another deep breath, you jog up the final steps and, with several great pushes, barely manage to open the heavy front doors and [[slip inside.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="slip inside." tags="" position="25,3150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	The guild hall bristles with activity. To one side, adventurers sit at rows of long, wooden tables, eating bowls of porridge and hot milk, some laughing and carousing, others sullenly rubbing the sleep from their eyes. A low fire burns in one of the many hearths, chasing away any morning chill that followed you inside, but the braziers and the chandeliers hanging overhead remain unlit. To the other side, rickety staircases spiral up to the barracks; adventurers lean against the banister, drinking from steaming mugs, watching the commotion downstairs. On the ground level, several open doors reveal training rooms, armories, granaries, spare storage rooms, and the stables. Your mind spins; the guild hall looks large enough from the outside, but the inside is somehow far more expansive. [[You suspect magic.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="You suspect magic." tags="" position="25,3275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Directly ahead, at the end of the deep blue carpet that rolls down the length of the hall, you can see the candlelit counters you always dreamed of but never thought you would see. At those wooden counters, in those narrow booths, you will apply for an adventure with a [[Quest-Giver.]] Of course, it is far too early for any Quest-Giver to be awake—the shutters to the booths’ windows are drawn shut—but you know you have to register your role and join a party somewhere. You notice other newcomers sitting in some of the booths, heads bowed over a roll of parchment, quills wildly scribbling. You figure they know what to do more than you do, and [[approach them from across the hall.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="Quest-Giver." tags="" position="150,3275" size="100,100">Double-click this passage to edit it.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="51" name="approach them from across the hall." tags="" position="25,3400" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
As you walk down the hall, you gaze at the adventurers who have gathered this morning. An elf ranger sits with her back against the wall, busily restringing her bow, rubbing the elegant weapon of wood down with oil. You had a childhood friend who always took the role of ranger when you played together. He found the role fun, but you never took any interest in it. You spot a dwarf guardian cleaning his buckler, scepter resting beside him. Another role you never found particularly exciting. In fact, of all the roles, you like the guardian the least. Not that there is anything inherently wrong with guardians. [[It’s just, it isn’t...you.]]

	Your favourite story was the Legend of Benevere, a brilliant and courageous &lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;. In his last adventure, his party took on a chimera and greatly underestimated its strength. Benevere watched his party members fall, one by one, around him, until only he and one other companion remained—the mage Ealanora, who alone had the power to renew those who had fallen. In an act of legendary bravery, Benevere unleashed every skill he knew, used every weapon he had, employed every technique of combat that he had ever learned, in a final effort to distract the chimera and allow Ealanora to cast her spell. He sustained great injury—injuries that would never truly heal—but his job was done; Ealanora brought their party back from the brink of death, and together, they defeated their [[monstrous foe.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="monstrous foe." tags="" position="25,4550" size="100,100">You finish the last letter and drop the quill with a [heavy exhale.] [There.] You’ve done it. You’ve joined the Adventurers’ Guild.

You look back at the parchment. Now you will be placed into a party—a group of fiercely loyal comrades who will fight, dine, live, and die alongside you. This is as important as declaring your role; most likely, you will spend the rest of your adventuring days alongside your party. You watch the parchment, the hastily scribbled “&lt;role&gt;” [lingering at the top…] but instead of assigning you to a party, the paper suddenly erases what you wrote. “&lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;” disappears. And the parchment continues [[writing itself.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="writing itself." tags="" position="25,4800" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
“And your party role shall be…guardian.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You stare at the paper in [confusion.]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[Guardian?]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Perhaps your handwriting, in your haste, was too difficult to read and confused the parchment. Perhaps this was an error, some sort of magical malfunction. This probably happens often, right? Magic was a finnicky thing, after all. Of course. You grab the quill, scratch out “guardian,” and [[once again write &lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE %&gt;-&gt;once again write]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="once again write" tags="" position="25,4925" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Your writing disappears—a little quicker this time—and is stubbornly replaced by “guardian.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[What?]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[No.]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[No.]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Surely this is some sort of mistake? It has to be! You are not sure what is happening, but you know this cannot be right. You cross out “guardian” and write “&lt;role&gt;” once more, this time more slowly, taking care to define every curve and line of every letter. There. No room for error there, surely. [[You are certain this time it will accept your desired role.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="59" name="You are certain this time it will accept your desired role." tags="" position="25,5050" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	You’ve barely finished the last letter before the first one begins disappearing, emptiness eating up the ink, “guardian” rewriting itself back onto the paper. Your confusion has given way to anxiety; you can feel the first sharp pangs of panic shorten your breathing, your mind smothered by frustration. Something is wrong. Something is so very wrong. Why isn’t it letting you choose your role? Why is this stupid scrap of yellowed paper trying to stop you? Are you doing something wrong? You can’t be doing something wrong! There’s nothing wrong about this—everyone gets to choose their own role, you’re not doing anything out of the ordinary, this is normal—but this isn’t normal, it obviously isn’t, or [[it would let you choose and it isn’t—]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	“And your party role shall be guardian,” the parchment reads. And you feel a twinge of anger, a soft snap inside, as if something has given way in your heart.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[[Ask help of the person in the neighboring booth.]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	You inhale deeply and steady your breathing. Anger will hardly help you here. Instead, you stand up abruptly and walk over to the next booth. A young, gangly fellow is seated there, filling out his own paper. He looks up.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Are you having trouble declaring your role as well?” you ask, trying to put on a pleasant face.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	He frowns.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Declare?” he asks. [[“What do ye mean, declare?”]]

&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="Tear the paper apart." tags="" position="150,5300" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The parchment resists all attempts at mangling. You half expected as much, but this hardly assuages your rage. It’s ridiculous. It’s utterly inane. Is this not the Adventurers’ Guild, famed and admired and built upon the fortunes of the city itself? How can it allow for such botched operations, such archaic and dysfunctional procedures? This isn’t the Dark Ages. A guild of this size should have this nonsense figured out by now!
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	After attempting to stab the word “guardian” out of the parchment several times, you finally stand up and walk over to the next booth. A young, gangly fellow is seated there, filling out his own paper. He looks up—and balks at the [[murderous look on your face.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;

	“Of course it cannae let ye. Roles are assigned. Ye don’t get tae choose them.” He taps his quill on the scroll before him. “It’s a powerful magic, I hear. Looks deep, tae the very essence of yer being.” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Your heart almost seems to choke on its own ire, throbbing with fury in the pit of your chest.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I takes it ye don’t come from ‘round these here parts?” the boy asks tentatively.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;

	“Why can’t I declare my role?” you demand. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	He looks a bit frightened by this aggressive display. You admit, you feel a bit guilty; it’s hardly his fault, there’s no need to vent your frustrations on him.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Declare?” he asks. “What do ye mean, declare?”
“I want to be a &lt;s.CHOSENROLE&gt;, so I tried to write it on the parchment, but it won’t let me!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The youth looks confused. You don’t know why he looks so bewildered. [[How does he think you feel?!]]

&lt;/div&gt;

	“Well, if ye were born in Eorundem, yer role would have been declared the moment ye left yer mother’s womb. The healer or wisewoman who aided yer birth would ‘ave a good look at ye, and then she would determine yer role.” The fellow smiles proudly. “Me father says it took them less than a ‘eartbeat to know I was a ranger—and that’d I’d be a damn good one at that. Agile and healthy, that’s what they said…”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	It takes him a moment to notice your flushed cheeks and watering eyes, and the perplexed expression returns. Then he sees your clenched and shaking fists, and the [[slight alarm follows.]]

	You force a smile—though your trembling lower lip protests, thwarting the attempt—and agree. The youth beams at you.

	“See? It might be weird if ye weren’t raised knowin’ ‘bout it, but it’s not so hard a thing to get used to, eh? Tis the natural way of this world, and everything works out just fine. As I told ye, tis a powerful magic that knows these things—and it is never wrong.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Yes. Never wrong. Of course,” [[you say shortly]].

	&lt;div&gt;
	He stares at you.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Change? Yer role?” He pauses, waiting for the punchline of a joke you didn’t tell. When he finally accepts that you aren’t jesting, he snorts loudly. “I ‘ave never even ‘eard of such nonsense. Ye cannae change your role. Ye are born with it. Ye are yer role for life. Tis the natural way of this world. Why would ye even want to try and “change” yer role? That’s…no one does that!”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“But what if I’ve been given the wrong role?” [[you ask, almost desperate.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;

	“Ye should check the parchment then, see what party ye been assigned to—oy, where are ye going?”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	He watches in mild confusion as you [[hurry away]], mashing at your teary eyes with one fist.
&lt;/div&gt;

You’re furious. No, not quite furious; you’re too distraught to be simply furious. It’s a different sort of emotion that you feel—an anger that was conceived of bewilderment and born of panic. Yes, you’re angry. Angry at yourself for being so [[emotional]]. Angry at yourself for being so [[foolish]]. Angry at whatever “ancient magics” that now usurp your dreams and dictate your life. You look down at the parchment crumpled in your fist. How can such a tiny scrap of paper determine your role so completely? How can one little word—“guardian”—ruin you entirely? You read again the damning text. Beneath it, you see your [[party assignment:]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	He peers at you as if some unnatural growth has sprouted from your face.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I told ye, tis a powerful magic that knows these things—and it is never wrong. Ye might as well—oy, where are ye going?”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	He watches in utter bemusement as you [[hurry away]], mashing at your teary eyes with one fist, quivering lip caught between your teeth.
	&lt;/div&gt;

“Party: Brutus, knight. Orante, mage. Incerta, rogue. &lt;Name&gt;, guardian. Barracks: Room 152.” You decide you might as well go to the barracks and meet your party; it will give you something to do, something to keep your mind preoccupied. You walk down the hall and [[climb up the stairs.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="76" name="climb up the stairs." tags="" position="25,6425" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You are certain now that some sort of magic is making the hall’s interior larger than it has any right to be; the barracks’ corridors stretch on for an eternity, windows letting in light from impossible angles, sleepy adventurers spilling out from open doorways. However, you are no longer quite as awed by this enchantment as you were when you first set foot in the [guild hall.]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	It takes you a little while to find Room 152, but you reach it sooner than you would have preferred. [[You linger just beyond the doorway.]]

	[“Ho there, adventurer!”]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	A deep voice rumbles forth from the room, followed by a tall man. His skin is the dark spice colour of a southern orc, his pupils dark pinpricks swimming in luminous lime green. He grins down at you, lips peeling away from his curved fangs. His rigid muscles strain through his tunic, his broad hands [[dry and calloused.]] 
	&lt;/div&gt;

	“You must be our newest addition. &lt;Name&gt;, was it? Welcome,” he says. “My name is Brutus. Knight.” He casually flexes, as if his role was not [[apparent enough already.]] &lt; If role is knight &gt; You cannot help but feel a little jealous. How pleasant it must be, to be so certain of one’s role. You wonder what it is like—to know, since birth, and to be completely comfortable with the knowledge.

	An elf woman slips past his broad frame and approaches you, head tilted, grey eyes curious. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“And I am Orante. Mage,” she says. Her voice is [[soft -- velvet-like, almost.]] &lt; If role is mage &gt; You cannot help but feel a little jealous. How pleasant it must be, to be so certain of one’s role. You wonder what it is like—to know, since birth, and to be completely comfortable with the knowledge.

	You hear the muted patter of footsteps behind you—and then a slim woman hurries past you, swift and nearly-silent. You catch a brief glimpse of her face, of a mess of raven’s wing hair and dark, hooded eyes. And then she disappears, gone as [[shadow goes before light.]]  
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="81" name="shadow goes before light." tags="Need-Help" position="25,7050" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
“That was Incerta. Rogue. A bit shy, that one, but [[she means no offense,”]] Brutus chuckles. &lt; If role is rogue &gt; You shift slightly, peering between Brutus and Orante, to watch the rogue slip on a cloak and pull its hood over her head. You cannot help but feel a little jealous. That could have been you in there, donning your cape and cowl, no one to doubt you, no papers or magics to stop you. How pleasant it must be, to be so certain of one’s role. You wonder what it is like—to know, since birth, and to be completely comfortable with the knowledge.

	&lt;div&gt;
	“Looks like you’re our new guardian,” Brutus continues. His voice sounds as if he is speaking through a mouthful of gravel.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[[“Looks that way, doesn’t it.”]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[[“About that…”]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
