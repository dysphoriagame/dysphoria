You had dreamed of venturing to the mystical land of Eorundem ever since you were a child. Your [father] would tell you grand tales of its rivers teeming with lost treasures, of the magical creatures that roamed its verdant hills, of the fathomless caverns that shivered with beastly roars, and of the endless forests that bristled with magic and seemed to whisper at night. And who could forget the ancient foe that plagued the land every several years? The [stories] of [Ye Olde Evil’s] repeated vanquishing were among your favourites. Now that you have come of age, it is no surprise you’ve chosen to set off for Eorundem, your [mother’s] blessing still lingering on your cheek. [[It is time for an adventure.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="father" tags="" position="150,25" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt; A good man. As dedicated to the smithy as he is to his family.

	Your father knew many stories. Ballad of Bhavulthrolo, wandering bard who serenaded a mountain until it moved out of his way, if only to escape his horrendous singing. Legend of Llyr Windeater, Prince of Kites, who wore a paper cape of many colours that granted him the gift of flight.

	You join a caravan—a motley band of merchants and travelers—heading into Eorundem, claiming a seat among sacks of spices and crates of dried fruit. You spend your days with wide, awestruck eyes as the everchanging [landscape] rolls languidly by; at night you watch strange constellations chase each other across the sky. Your travels are briefly halted by a stampede of three-headed, fire-breathing buffalo, and two wagons losing their wheels to mischievous gremlins—and for three days straight a deluge of strange rain coats the rivers in fine silver. However, these slight mishaps only further whet your appetite for adventure, and [[your anticipation only grows.]]
&lt;div&gt;

	The sky seems boundless out here. It is as if the very world has opened itself up. The horizon has never seemed so far away before, and nothing—no village huts or crowding trees—breaks the great expanse of blue overhead. In the distance, you can see stone temples carved from the mountain range, glistening with ice. The lush meadows stretch in all directions from the dusty road, their grasses swelling and rolling in the wind, their slopes flecked with flowers. White stags with six pink eyes watch your procession from the safety of the forests, but they scatter when something roars from deep within the woods.
&lt;/div&gt;

	{“What brings you to Cysa?”}, you ask.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“My trade. I am a merchant,” she replies. “My village to the east makes a special butter from the gossamer worms that grow in the nearby caverns. It’s considered a delicacy in Cysa, often spread over stuffed bread.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	{“That sounds…lovely.”} It does not, in fact, sound lovely at all.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	She laughs.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I know it hardly sounds appetizing, but truly, the creamy sweetness of gossamer worm against savory stuffed bread is a step and a half from heaven.” She giggles. “On special occasions, we make it with [[moon slugs as well.]]”

	After what seems like an eternity, the caravan leader announces that you are but a day away from Cysa, capital city of Eorundem, the Flower-by-the-Sea. You are not the only excited one; the air just about crackles with energy that night, and suppertime chatter is particularly loud and laughter-filled. Having slopped a [small helping] of meat stew on your platter, you take a seat near a [young woman] with kind eyes. You have seen her here and there throughout the past weeks. She always seemed rather friendly and helpful, but your paths never crossed until now. [[She smiles as you sit down.]]

	You gently set your platter down, food untouched and significantly less appetizing. The merchant hastily changes the subject.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Tell me, then, what brings you to Cysa?” she asks.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I want to be an adventurer,” you say confidently.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Oh?”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Yes. It’s all I ever dreamed of as a child. I would act out my father’s stories with my friends. We made quite the party, slaying all sorts of monsters every day. [[Imaginary ones, of course.]]”

	“A &lt;%= s.ROLE %&gt; is always in demand somewhere, I’m sure,” she says.

	“It has grown late, and a busy day approaches. I think I’ll retire for the night,” she says. “It was a pleasure meeting you, friend. The name is Ana. Ana Ymra. Visit my vending stall in the marketplace if you ever fancy a taste of gourmet butter. Discount prices, just for you.”

	You nod and bid her farewell as she leaves. You linger by the fire for a little while longer, but when the other folk start to drift away, {you decide to return to your wagon.} As you nestle into your cot among the barrels of dried meat, your mind turns to Ana. Her odd change in demeanor confuses you. Did she have a particular dislike for &lt;chosen role&gt;? Perhaps you had been too boastful, too eager—perhaps she doubted your ability to succeed?

At times it seems to be growling, snarling after you in deep and grating tones. Other times its voice goes soft, like well-worn velvet. And then it goes quiet, and all you can hear are soft footsteps from the surrounding shadows. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You try to run faster, but you are carrying weapons upon weapons—swords, shields, staffs, tomes, daggers, bows—and your shoulders and legs are weighed down by mismatched armor. Just when you can nearly feel the hot breath of your pursuer on your neck and the cold bite of metal, you [[trip]]
	&lt;/div&gt;

	{You open your eyes.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	It is morning. You have arrived at Cysa, city capital of Eorundem, Flower-by-the-Sea.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You gather your belongings and burst out of your wagon, nightmares forgotten, eager to see what you have only dreamed of until [[now.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="now." tags="" position="25,1775" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Marble watchtowers and gilded arches greet your eyes, glittering brilliantly in the rising sun, the festive banners of royal blue and white draped from frosted windows stirring in the wind. When you peer upwards, you can see guards in silver armor and creamy furs pacing along the battlements. Elaborate [statues] unfurl from the corbels, shaped of intricate glasswork and masterful stone carving. A well-worn [drawbridge] groans beneath your wagon’s wheels as the caravan slowly rolls into the city. [[You can hardly keep yourself from dashing ahead.]]
&lt;div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="drawbridge" tags="" position="275,1775" size="100,100">If you peer over the side of the drawbridge, you can see the fabled Mirror Moat below, the polished sheen of its surface perfectly reflecting the sky above.

	As you stride down the wide [thoroughfare], dusty boots slapping against the pristine stones underfoot, you notice the citizens of Cysa begin to take interest in the city’s newest additions. A pair of slender elves watch coolly from their balcony, sipping tea and eating thin slices of raw fish. A gaggle of human children run alongside the caravan, giggling and pointing, until they are distracted by a bright blue butterfly and chase it down a side street. A group of dwarves pause their card game to shout greetings, grinning broadly at the parade of newcomers. You get some surly, incurious looks from an orc woman struggling to hang her laundry on one of the many clotheslines that [[swing over alleyways.]] 
&lt;div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="thoroughfare" tags="" position="150,1900" size="100,100">The white stone houses that line the broad street stretch at least three stories high, their elegant verandas extending from curtain-covered openings, each door painted a different shade of blue or green.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="statues" tags="" position="150,1775" size="100,100">	A woman of silvered stone stretches her hands out to you, her marbled face serene, her gown billowing about her as she unfolds from her corbel. An imp hangs from his corbel, clutching a gilded tome, face forever suspended in a look of wild glee.

	You quickly learn why Cysa is known as the Flower-by-the-Sea; the city is designed to mimic a rose and its innumerable folds. Each district is a petal, each road following the intricate pattern of the flower’s irregular whorls. It is the very center of the rose—the close cluster of petals—that holds the marketplace, [[the heart of Cysa.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="swing over alleyways." tags="" position="25,2025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	A bard sitting on a doorstep sings a hastily-composed ode to you and your companions, but frowns and stops when no one tips him. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Overhead, a hanging garden dangles from the marble arches. Baskets overflow with spiraling violet flowers and tumbling cascades of snowy blossoms, the exotic florae showering the caravan with petals in each gust of wind. Colourful birds flit among the green tendrils and bursts of leaves. Above, the sky is a patchwork of vibrant blues and white clouds. You breathe in deeply. The air is refreshingly cool and crusted with sea salt. You shiver—partially from the cold, partially from [[nervous excitement.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="41" name="the heart of Cysa." tags="" position="25,2275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	{Your nose knows the marketplace before your eyes do.} Strong spices, roasting meats, pungent fruits, cooking vegetables, salted fish, and baking breads assault that singular sense first. {Next are your ears.]} The sound of people laughing and shouting, wagons creaking, animals braying and squawking and barking, foods sizzling, and the distant thunder of the sea overpowers your hearing. [[By the time you enter the marketplace and embrace it with your eyes, you’re already overwhelmed.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="By the time you enter the marketplace and embrace it with your eyes, you’re already overwhelmed." tags="" position="25,2400" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	The merchants’ vending stalls and carts are gathered in the center of the marketplace, a cluster of bright colours, exotic wares, and traders eagerly offering their merchandise to passersby. The caravan quickly dissolves at the sight of this, most of the travelers unhitching their wagons or unfolding their vending stalls, eager to join the cluster of merchants. You catch sight of Ana Ymra unpacking crates filled with jars of purple ooze; you shudder and look away. Gathering your belongings, you leave what is left of the caravan behind and head off in search of the [[Adventurers’ Guild.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="43" name="Adventurers’ Guild." tags="" position="25,2525" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	The marketplace is exceptionally busy today. Crowds weave in jostling, chattering ribbons through the merchant stalls, winding in and out of the ring of shops along the marketplace’s edge. Smells and sounds wash over you in powerful waves. Your eyes can barely focus on any one thing, much less take in the scene in its entirety. For a moment, you are almost paralyzed by the sheer amount of commotion and noise. You have finally reached the famed city of Cysa after so many years of dreaming and waiting, and for the first time, you can do anything, be anything—yet now that you’re here, you find you can hardly move. [[That is, until someone taps your shoulder.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="That is, until someone taps your shoulder." tags="" position="25,2650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You spin around, wondering if pickpockets are particularly prevalent in Cysa. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Forgive me, I could not help but notice…you look rather lost,” {someone says.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You take a moment to appraise the hooded person before you. At first glance, the person comes off as rather manly; their frame is stocky and well-muscled, their voice low and a bit gravelly. However, at a closer glance at the softness of their face beneath the cowl—and the shape of their body beneath the robe—you realize that you are, in fact, [[speaking to a woman.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="45" name="speaking to a woman." tags="" position="25,2775" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Yes, I am lost. I was looking for the Adventurers’ Guild…?” you answer.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Of course you are.” The woman points at a nearby spire from which a blue pennant flutters. “Simply follow those flags. They will lead you to the Adventurers’ Guild. The guild hall itself is hard to miss.” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Looking up now, you can in fact see a series of pennants curving around the marketplace, leading elsewhere. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Thank you, ma’am,” you say gratefully. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The woman [[seems to flinch, already walking away.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="seems to flinch, already walking away." tags="" position="25,2900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“New adventurers come here often. The citizens of Cysa have grown quite accustomed to giving you lot directions,” she mutters.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You don’t bother dwelling on her strange reaction or rather brusque response; you have a guild hall to find and a party to join. You set off, eyes firmly fixed on the [[trail of banners.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="47" name="trail of banners." tags="" position="25,3025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	As you march up the broad, sweeping stairs that lead to the guild hall, you wonder how you could not have seen the structure in question. Unlike the rest of the city, the hall is made of burnished wood, the crest of its roof curving in an arc, the walls bulging outwards before tapering sharply in the back. In fact, the more you marvel at it, the more it looks like a massive ship that has been cut in half and turned upside down in the middle of the city. Its broad oaken doors are flanked by two rippling banners, each bearing the crest of Cysa: sapphire rose against white.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	After steeling yourself and taking another deep breath, you jog up the final steps and, with several great pushes, barely manage to open the heavy front doors and [[slip inside.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="48" name="slip inside." tags="" position="25,3150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	The guild hall bristles with activity. To one side, adventurers sit at rows of long, wooden tables, eating bowls of porridge and hot milk, some laughing and carousing, others sullenly rubbing the sleep from their eyes. A low fire burns in one of the many hearths, chasing away any morning chill that followed you inside, but the braziers and the chandeliers hanging overhead remain unlit. To the other side, rickety staircases spiral up to the barracks; adventurers lean against the banister, drinking from steaming mugs, watching the commotion downstairs. On the ground level, several open doors reveal training rooms, armories, granaries, spare storage rooms, and the stables. Your mind spins; the guild hall looks large enough from the outside, but the inside is somehow far more expansive. [[You suspect magic.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="49" name="You suspect magic." tags="" position="25,3275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Directly ahead, at the end of the deep blue carpet that rolls down the length of the hall, you can see the candlelit counters you always dreamed of but never thought you would see. At those wooden counters, in those narrow booths, you will apply for an adventure with a [Quest-Giver.] Of course, it is far too early for any Quest-Giver to be awake—the shutters to the booths’ windows are drawn shut—but you know you have to register your role and join a party somewhere. You notice other newcomers sitting in some of the booths, heads bowed over a roll of parchment, quills wildly scribbling. You figure they know what to do more than you do, and [[approach them from across the hall.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="50" name="Quest-Giver." tags="" position="150,3275" size="100,100">Wizened men and women who have seen sunrise and storm aplenty, and have survived them all.

As you walk down the hall, you gaze at the adventurers who have gathered this morning. An elf ranger sits with her back against the wall, busily restringing her bow, rubbing the elegant weapon of wood down with oil. You had a childhood friend who always took the role of ranger when you played together. He found the role fun, but you never took any interest in it. You spot a dwarf guardian cleaning his buckler, scepter resting beside him. Another role you never found particularly exciting. In fact, of all the roles, you like the guardian the least. Not that there is anything inherently wrong with guardians. &lt;a onclick=&quot;Passage.checkRole()&quot;&gt;It’s just, it isn’t...you.&lt;/a&gt;

	Your favourite story was the Legend of Benevere, a brilliant and courageous &lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;. In his last adventure, his party took on a chimera and greatly underestimated its strength. Benevere watched his party members fall, one by one, around him, until only he and one other companion remained—the mage Ealanora, who alone had the power to renew those who had fallen. In an act of legendary bravery, Benevere unleashed every skill he knew, used every weapon he had, employed every technique of combat that he had ever learned, in a final effort to distract the chimera and allow Ealanora to cast her spell. He sustained great injury—injuries that would never truly heal—but his job was done; Ealanora brought their party back from the brink of death, and together, they defeated their [[monstrous foe.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="55" name="monstrous foe." tags="" position="25,4700" size="100,100">You finish the last letter and drop the quill with a {heavy exhale.} {There.} You’ve done it.

You look back at the parchment. Now you will be placed into a party—a group of fiercely loyal comrades who will fight, dine, live, and die alongside you. This is as important as declaring your role; most likely, you will spend the rest of your adventuring days alongside your party. You watch the parchment, the hastily scribbled “&lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;” {lingering at the top…} but instead of assigning you to a party, the paper suddenly erases what you wrote. “&lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;” disappears. And the parchment continues [[writing itself.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="57" name="writing itself." tags="" position="25,4950" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
“And your party role shall be…guardian.”

	&lt;div&gt;
	You stare at the paper in {confusion.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	{Guardian?}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Perhaps your handwriting, in your haste, was too difficult to read and confused the parchment. Perhaps this was an error, some sort of magical malfunction. This probably happens often, right? Magic was a finnicky thing, after all. Of course. You grab the quill, scratch out “guardian,” and [[once again write &lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE %&gt;-&gt;once again write]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="58" name="once again write" tags="" position="25,5075" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Your writing disappears—a little quicker this time—and is stubbornly replaced by “guardian.”

	&lt;div&gt;
	{No.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	{No.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Surely this is some sort of mistake? It has to be! You are not sure what is happening, but you know this cannot be right. You cross out “guardian” and write “&lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE %&gt;” once more, this time more slowly, taking care to define every curve and line of every letter. There. No room for error there, surely. [[You are certain this time it will accept your desired role.]]

	You’ve barely finished the last letter before the first one begins disappearing, emptiness eating up the ink, “guardian” rewriting itself back onto the paper. Your confusion has given way to anxiety; you can feel the first sharp pangs of panic shorten your breathing, your mind smothered by frustration. Something is wrong. Something is so very wrong. Why isn’t it letting you choose your role? Why is this stupid scrap of yellowed paper trying to stop you? Are you doing something wrong? You can’t be doing something wrong! There’s nothing wrong about this—everyone gets to choose their own role, you’re not doing anything out of the ordinary, this is normal—but this isn’t normal, it obviously isn’t, or [[it would let you choose and it isn’t—]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	“And your party role shall be guardian,” the parchment reads. And you feel a twinge of anger, a soft snap inside, as if something has given way in your heart.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[[Ask help of the person in the neighboring booth.]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	You inhale deeply and steady your breathing. Anger will hardly help you here. Instead, you stand up abruptly and walk over to the next booth. A young, gangly fellow is seated there, filling out his own paper. He looks up.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Are you having trouble declaring your role as well?” you ask, trying to put on a pleasant face.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	He frowns.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Declare?” he asks. [[“What do ye mean, declare?”]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	The parchment resists all attempts at mangling. You half expected as much, but this hardly assuages your rage. It’s ridiculous. It’s utterly inane. Is this not the Adventurers’ Guild, famed and admired and built upon the fortunes of the city itself? How can it allow for such botched operations, such archaic and dysfunctional procedures? This isn’t the Dark Ages. A guild of this size should have this nonsense figured out by now!
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	After attempting to stab the word “guardian” out of the parchment several times, you finally stand up and walk over to the next booth. A young, gangly fellow is seated there, filling out his own paper. He looks up—and balks at the [[murderous look on your face.]]

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Your heart almost seems to choke on its own ire, throbbing with fury in the pit of your chest.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I takes it ye don’t come from ‘round these here parts?” the boy asks tentatively.

	&lt;div&gt;
	He looks a bit frightened by this aggressive display. You admit, you feel a bit guilty; it’s hardly his fault, there’s no need to vent your frustrations on him.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Declare?” he asks. “What do ye mean, declare?”
“I want to be a &lt;s.CHOSENROLE&gt;, so I tried to write it on the parchment, but it won’t let me!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The youth looks confused. You don’t know why he looks so bewildered. [[How does he think you feel?!]]

Agile and healthy, that’s what they said…”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	It takes him a moment to notice your flushed cheeks and watering eyes, and the perplexed expression returns. Then he sees your clenched and shaking fists, and the [[slight alarm follows.]]

Ye already ‘ave been assigned to a party. Guardians are ‘ighly crucial to a party, I’ve been told. We always need more guardians!”

	&lt;div&gt;
	You force a smile—though your trembling lower lip protests, thwarting the attempt—and agree. The youth beams at you.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“See? It might be weird if ye weren’t raised knowin’ ‘bout it, but it’s not so hard a thing to get used to, eh? Tis the natural way of this world, and everything works out just fine. As I told ye, tis a powerful magic that knows these things—and it is never wrong.”

	He stares at you.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Change? Yer role?” He pauses, waiting for the punchline of a joke you didn’t tell. When he finally accepts that you aren’t jesting, he snorts loudly. “I ‘ave never even ‘eard of such nonsense. Ye cannae change your role. Ye are born with it. Ye are yer role for life. Tis the natural way of this world. Why would ye even want to try and “change” yer role? That’s…no one does that!”

You’re furious. No, not quite furious; you’re too distraught to be simply furious. It’s a different sort of emotion that you feel—an anger that was conceived of bewilderment and born of panic. Yes, you’re angry. Angry at yourself for being so [emotional]. Angry at yourself for being so [foolish]. Angry at whatever “ancient magics” that now usurp your dreams and dictate your life. You look down at the parchment crumpled in your fist. How can such a tiny scrap of paper determine your role so completely? How can one little word—“guardian”—ruin you entirely?

“Party: Brutus, knight. Orante, mage. Incerta, rogue. &lt;%= s.NAME%&gt;, guardian.

	You bite your lip and attempt to return his grin. Brutus’s smile broadens. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Hear that?” he calls to his other party members. “We have ourselves a guardian at last!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Orante claps politely. Only silence from Incerta. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“We’ve been in need of a guardian for some time now,” Orante explains. “We’re so glad you’re a guardian. If we had gotten another &lt;%=s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;, Brutus might’ve had a fit. We hardly need any more &lt;%=s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;s.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You feel something small within you wither and die.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Of course. Another &lt;%=s.CHOSENROLE%&gt; would be useless,” you agree. The words feel bitter on your tongue. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The elf smiles beatifically at you, and then beckons you inside. What an odd gesture. It’s as if you’ve passed her test, proven that you are normal, that you are one of them. You wonder if she would still invite you into their world if she knew what sort of [[imposter you are.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;
	You begin to protest—but you remember the look of utter shock and confusion the boy at the booth gave you. The implication that there was something wrong with you, the way you were, what you wanted to be. You only just met your party members. {Is this really the time to bring this up?}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You might be emotional and foolish, but you certainly are not a coward. Of course it is the right time. It always is. And if you don’t sort this out now—if you don’t address the problem directly and immediately—it will soon be too late. You cannot very well mention something like this out on the battlefield, right? No. {This has to be done now.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I’m not sure about that, actually,” {you begin to say.} But before you can continue, Brutus cuts you off with a wave of his hand.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Whatever it is, it can wait. You need food, recruit. You’ll need a day of good food before you go on your first adventure,” he says. “How do you like the sound of that, eh? [[First adventure?]]

&lt;div&gt;

	“You must be hungry, recruit. You’ll need a day of good food before you go on your first adventure,” Brutus says. “How do you like the sound of that, eh? First adventure?”

	&lt;div&gt;
	“It sounds…nice,” you say hollowly.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus is too busy reminiscing to take note of your unenthusiastic response.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I remember my first adventure. I was a green lad then, more nerves and excitement than muscle. The last bit has changed, obviously.” He flexes again. You hear a seam rip somewhere. You have no desire to know the location. “And the nerves go with time. But the excitement never left me. And it will never leave you, either, recruit. We’ll have wondrous adventures, the lot of us will.”
	&lt;/div&gt;

	“This is actually rather urgent,” you begin again.

	Brutus seems to suffer from selective hearing, because he continues talking over you.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;

	Brutus winks.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“First day nerves, eh? We shall bring extra provisions, then. Nothing like a good day of explorin’ and fightin’ to stir up an appetite. And trust me, you’ll need plenty of food if you ever wish to look as I do.” He doesn’t flex this time, but he does roll his sleeves up, exposing the corded muscles running up the length of his forearms, the skin leathery beneath swathes of shiny scars.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Orante and I will head down to break our fast, then. Incerta? Still need to pick up that new poniard from the blacksmith? Perfect. Take our new recruit along with you. [[&lt;%= s.NAME%&gt;’ll need some new gear.” -&gt; need some new gear.&quot;]]

	The rogue moves with incredible speed. This is hardly surprising, but you do wish she would at least pause every {once in a while.} She finally comes to a full stop at the edge of the marketplace, half-turning towards you as you stumble down the last steps.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“So, will you be showing me around?” you ask hopefully. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I will be tending to my own business. You can do as you please. And I’m sure you can find your way back,” she says shortly. With that, she slips into the crowd, melting into the patchwork sea of cloaks and capes and shadows [[before your very eyes.]] &lt;If role is rogue&gt; You watch in silent wonder. Guardians certainly cannot do that. 
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Incerta mumbles something; a moment later, she slinks out of the room, a pack slung over one shoulder. She heads down the hallway without a glance at you. You look around for guidance, but Brutus has disappeared into the room and Orante is nowhere to be seen. After a second of hesitation, [[you hurry after Incerta.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="91" name="before your very eyes." tags="" position="25,8075" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	After taking a second to gather your thoughts, you steel yourself and venture into the [[marketplace.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="92" name="marketplace." tags="" position="25,8225" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	The marketplace has calmed somewhat since this morning. Citizens mill about, tearing at skewers of grilled meats, picking at loaves of fruit-encrusted bread with their bare hands, carrying pails of milk and water back to their homes. The air is filled with idle chatter and generous amounts of laughter. Nearly every shop is open today. The empty vials, bottles, and jars strung from the eaves of the [[apothecary shop]] clink together in the gentle wind. The [[smithy]] belches black clouds of smoke. The grocer’s and the mentor’s shops are closed.
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="93" name="apothecary shop" tags="" position="600,8175" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The apothecary shop would have been a decent-sized shop, if not for the clutter. The shelves seem to lean forward precariously, each level in danger of spilling its precious cargo of containers. Jars, bottles, vials, pails, pans, pots, and upturned helms have all been employed to carry some sort of powder or liquid or dried animal part. Crates crowd the floor, each filled beyond their brims with leathered hides, exotic flora, and assorted bones. Piles of books vie for space amidst the mess. Strange creatures squawk and screech from cages hanging overhead.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The [apothecary] herself peers up from her mortar and pestle, and the thing she had been trying to pulverize takes this opportunity to escape.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“And what can I do fer ye, dearie?” she asks.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	&quot;Oh, I was just looking around the marketplace… In fact, I should get going,&quot; you hurry out back to the [[marketplace.-&gt;marketplace after apothecary]]

	The smithy greets you with a blast of hot air and the rhythmic din of metal upon metal. The forge is stained by a hundred vermillion hues, the stone walls colourless without the violent flashes of fire and brilliant sprays of sparks. The furnace flares and growls in the back, illuminating the apprentices working at the anvils. Weapons and armors hang in rows against the walls, some sorely in need of repair, some polished and gleaming. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The [blacksmith] moves to the counter, wiping his hands off on his apron. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“New adventurer, eh?” he asks, looking you over. “Don’t think I’ve seen you before. Lucky for you, because new recruits get their first set of gear for free. Standard set, of course. Nothing fancy. Unless you have the coin for it.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;

	“Guardian,” you say. It feels as if you are forcibly peeling the word from your tongue. The residue it leaves behind is sour. You drop your eyes to the floor, avoiding the blacksmith’s. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The blacksmith grunts and slaps your gear down on the counter. He watches you with a faint frown as you numbly gather the heavy armor, shield, and scepter—the trappings of a guardian.

	&lt;div&gt;
	“M-hmm.” He does not look convinced, but he does not prod you any further. “Wear your gear well, then, guardian.” And with that, &lt;a onclick=&quot;Passage.checkChosenRole()&quot;&gt;he returns to his work.&lt;/a&gt;

	You give the blacksmith a broad smile. He nods gruffly and returns to his work, no doubt well accustomed to the giddy excitement of green recruits about to embark on their first adventure. Still, you think you see him grin a little as he turns away.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	As you leave, you look down at the gear gathered in your arms and slung about your shoulders. You feel some elation bubble up within you—but it soon sinks, solid and weighed down by the concerns of reality. You wonder what you will say to your party. Will they allow this? Will they listen? Your elation sours, curdling into a creeping uncertainty that seizes up breath and heartbeat and all you can remember is the look that boy in the booth gave you shocked so strange [[do not understand—]]

	*Guardian.* He called you guardian. And how heavily those words weigh upon your shoulders, and everything inside you sinks, coalescing into one solid mass in your chest. You grip the guardian’s scepter, swinging it around a bit. You heft the heavy shield, tying the straps around your forearm. It feels…wrong. This isn’t how you imagined it. This isn’t what you wanted. You find yourself wondering if you made the right choice. If you had told the blacksmith that you were a &lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE %&gt;, would you still feel this dissatisfaction, [[this flat emptiness?]] &lt; If knight &gt; If you were holding a claymore or an axe now, how happy you would be. &lt; If mage &gt; If you were clutching a staff or a tome now, how happy you would be. &lt; If rogue &gt; If you had a set of daggers at your hips now, how happy you would be.

	You think, then, of your party members. You did this to avoid their questions, their stares, and the shock and confusion that would inevitably follow. You remember that boy in the booth, and that look in his eyes—the look that told you that you were abnormal, that you were something strange, something that did not belong. How many more times must you endure such looks? No, this way is easier. Safer. Yes. For now. Just for now.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You leave the smithy, entering the [[marketplace-&gt;marketplace after blacksmith]] once more.

	The marketplace has calmed somewhat since this morning. Citizens mill about, tearing at skewers of grilled meats, picking at loaves of fruit-encrusted bread with their bare hands, carrying pails of milk and water back to their homes. The air is filled with idle chatter and generous amounts of laughter. Nearly every shop is open today.

	The marketplace has calmed somewhat since this morning.

	&lt;div&gt;
	The apothecary shop would have been a decent-sized shop, if not for the clutter. The shelves seem to lean forward precariously, each level in danger of spilling its precious cargo of containers. Jars, bottles, vials, pails, pans, pots, and upturned helms have all been employed to carry some sort of powder or liquid or dried animal part. Crates crowd the floor, each filled beyond their brims with leathered hides, exotic flora, and assorted bones. Piles of books vie for space amidst the mess. Strange creatures squawk and screech from cages hanging overhead.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The [apothecary] herself peers up from her mortar and pestle, and the thing she had been trying to pulverize takes this opportunity to escape.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“And what can I do fer ye, dearie?” she asks.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;
	The smithy greets you with a blast of hot air and the rhythmic din of metal upon metal. The forge is stained by a hundred vermillion hues, the stone walls colourless without the violent flashes of fire and brilliant sprays of sparks. The furnace flares and growls in the back, illuminating the apprentices working at the anvils. Weapons and armors hang in rows against the walls, some sorely in need of repair, some polished and gleaming. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The [blacksmith] moves to the counter, wiping his hands off on his apron. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“New adventurer, eh?” he asks, looking you over. “Don’t think I’ve seen you before. Lucky for you, because new recruits get their first set of gear for free. Standard set, of course. Nothing fancy. Unless you have the coin for it.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Standard, please.” Your coin purse almost seems to sigh in relief. Or perhaps that is the air moving through [[its empty innards.-&gt;its empty innards.2]]

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You freeze, mind racing. On the one hand…no little slip of paper is stopping you from grabbing the gear of a &lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE %&gt;. On the other hand, what will your party say? Is the pain of trying to conform worth the social gratification, that elusive sense of acceptance so many crave?

	You gaze at the center of the marketplace, where the merchants and their many stalls are gathered. You catch sight of a certain trader and her jars of purple ooze. {Ana Ymra.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You remember her parting words. “Talk to me if things do not go as you thought they would,” she had said. Your eyes narrow, irritation tangling with desperation. Things have certainly not been going as you thought they would. You think it is about time you and Ana [[had a talk.]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	Ana gives you a broad smile when you reach her stall.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Oh? Come to me so soon? Had a sudden craving for exotic butter?” she laughs. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Not butter. Tea. You said we could talk?” you say shortly, stating more than asking. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Her face falls ever so slightly. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Ah. I see.” She turns and begins removing her wares from the stall counter. “Come, join me in my wagon.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You follow her up the wooden stairs and through the flaps of canvas that serve as [[doors.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="116" name="doors." tags="" position="25,9050" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	After the tea water has been made and poured, Ana settles down on a stool near her cot. You remain standing, taking careful sips from your teacup. The soothing drink calms you a bit—but not enough. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Why did you not tell me?” you demand. “Why did you say nothing when I went on and on about choosing my role? You knew people do not “choose” their roles, and yet you let me believe I could—and I went off and made a fool of myself today!”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Ana looks down at her own mug of tea. When she speaks, her voice is soft.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I will admit…I did not think you were entirely serious. Until I met you, I had…I had never heard of anyone wanting to be a role they were not. So, I figured that you had to be jesting. But I see now that you were not, somehow.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[[“I certainly was not jesting!” Anger colours your tone.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;
	Ana shrinks away slightly from the rage building in your voice.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“If not jesting, I imagined that you were simply indulging in some sort of fantasy…the imaginings of a young child, at most, playing make-believe, pretending…” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You set your tea down; your hands are shaking too much to hold it any longer. How little did this woman respect you, to think the greatest desire of your life was but a child’s whimsy? You had shared with her your most cherished dream and she had thought it was a jest. Did she return to her wagon laughing that night? Pitying you—you, the naïve child, the little fool? These thoughts only feed the [[fury smoldering in your heart.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="118" name="“What reason had you to think I was jesting?” you ask in genuine confusion." tags="" position="275,9175" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“It is just…it was so…foreign to me, the idea that someone would want to change their role. I didn’t know what to make of it,” she admits. “You had to be jesting, I thought. No one truly ever wants to change their role. No one ever even thinks about such a thing. Perhaps a foreigner might joke about such a thing, but I never thought anyone would…no one has ever…”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You feel a hot blush of shame creep over your cheeks. You grip your teacup tighter, trying to steady your shaking hands. You had shared your most cherished dream—the greatest desire of your life—with her, and she had thought it was but a jest.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Why did you not tell me, then? Tell me I could not choose my own role?” you ask. [[Even your voice is trembling.]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	“It is just…it was so…foreign to me, the idea that someone would want to change their role. I didn’t know what to make of it.” She looks up at you, and you can see the remorse—tainted by no small amount of bewilderment—in her clear eyes. “I did not mean to…to deceive you. That was never my intention.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[[“What were your intentions, then? Did you think you were merely entertaining a confused child?” you demand.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[[You feel some part of your anger abate. Whatever she did, she meant no harm to come of it.]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	Ana looks down again.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Nay. I thought I was sharing dinner with an innocent soul, full of hope and wonder, who had simply been misled. I thought I was talking to someone whose company I truly enjoyed—someone I had fervently hoped to see again. And I have. Seen you again, that is. I simply wish it had been in better circumstances.” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	As you gaze down on her slumped shoulders, on her fingers that tremble slightly even while curled around her mug, you feel your anger cool and give way to embarrassment. Even while protesting your childishness, [[you had behaved most immaturely.]] 
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="121" name="You feel some part of your anger abate. Whatever she did, she meant no harm to come of it." tags="" position="150,9425" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I am sure you did not mean to,” you say, attempting to take a reasonable tone. “But why not simply tell me that I could not choose my own role? You did not lie, not outright, but you hardly told the truth.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	She searches your face for any lingering traces of anger.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“If you were jesting, I thought I would play along. If you were not jesting, then you were surely still nursing the imaginings of a young child, still playing at make-believe…” She sighs. “You seemed to me such an innocent soul. So full of hope and wonder. I could not bring myself to shatter your childhood dreams. I see now that I chose the path of cowardice, not mercy.” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	A child. She thought of you as a mere child, still chasing after imaginary dragons with a wooden sword, still unburdened by the constraints of society. How silly she must have thought you were. [[How strange she must think you now.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="122" name="you had behaved most immaturely." tags="" position="25,9550" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Ana rises then, and moves to the canvas flaps, holding them apart for you.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I think it best that you leave now,” she murmurs.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“As do I.” You try to snap those words out, but your heart isn’t quite in it. Neither of you attempt to meet the other’s eyes as you make your way down the wagon’s steps. However, just as you begin to walk away, Ana calls out.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;

	You return to the guild hall, your satchel bursting with potions, your shoulders laden with gear. You see Brutus and Orante chatting and dining at one of the tables, but you feel too drained to try and interact with your party members right now. It has been a long day, and you would rather have a few moments alone. You head up to the barracks. [[A nap would be nice.]]

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I understand,” Ana murmurs.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	She rises then, and moves to the canvas flaps, holding them apart for you. Neither of you attempt to meet the other’s eyes as you make your way down the wagon’s steps. However, just as you begin to walk away, Ana calls out.

So full of hope and wonder. I could not bring myself to shatter your childhood dreams. I see now that I chose the path of cowardice, not mercy.” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	A child. She thought of you as a mere child, still chasing after imaginary dragons with a wooden sword, still unburdened by the constraints of society. How silly she must have thought you were.

	&lt;div&gt;
	You find you are not the only one hiding from your party; Incerta is sitting on her bed, twisting something between her hands. When she sees you, she smoothly hides it in her lap. However, you can still see some strands of string or fiber peeking up from her closed fists. You wonder what she is doing, playing with bits of sinew. Perhaps it is some new rogue trickery. You consider asking, but reconsider when you see the dark look she is giving you.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You clamber into your bunk and lie on your back with a heavy sigh. You notice that someone has carved a constellation into the wooden ceiling above you; you trace it out with your eyes until you feel yourself begin to &lt;a onclick=&quot;Passage.checkGear()&quot;&gt;drift away.&lt;/a&gt;

	That night you dream you are a turtle. You are surrounded by birds. They do not believe that you are a turtle. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“But look!” you cry. “I am wearing this shell for you! How can I not be a turtle?”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You reach around to rap on your thick shell for extra emphasis, but the birds take this as an invitation and begin to peck. And peck. And stab. And stab. And their beaks go through your armor as if it is mere flesh and they tear you apart and you watch the carnage from above wondering why 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;

	That night you dream you are hiding from something—that something you dreamt of before. That thing with the gravel voice and the silk voice, that thing that walks with muted footsteps. You stand still. You worry that if you move, it will see the darkness shifting and it will come snarling down upon you
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	but you will have to move eventually

	You open your eyes. You can hear the cry of ocean birds and the low seething of the sea. {It is morning.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    You quickly sit up. Your nap somehow turned into a full night’s worth of sleep. Not that you particularly mind. Yesterday was…long; you feel your spirits drop as you remember the {events of yesterday.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    “I see the recruit is finally awake!” Brutus’s voice rumbles in through the open door, preceding the massive knight. He carries a scroll in one hand and a platter of fruit and bread in the other, a jovial grin on his face. “I brought you some food, little one. Noticed you did not eat yesterday.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Oh, thank you,” you say gratefully. Now that you are awake, you realize how very hungry you have become. You hop out of your bunk and take the food from the knight. Relieved of the platter, Brutus unrolls the scroll and [[waves it about.]]

	“I swung by the Quest-Givers this mornin’ and got ourselves a quest. It’s an easy one. A good introduction for our newest member,” he continues. “We’re to clear out a beach near Cysa. They’ve been infested with Ye Olde Evil’s baddies as of late.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Sounds delightful,” Orante murmurs as she follows Brutus inside. Incerta nods silently from her own bed.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Perfect place to teach you how to use your skills and wield your weapons. Speaking of…” Brutus looks at your gear, &lt;a onclick=&quot;Passage.checkChosenRole()&quot;&gt;piled in the corner.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="132" name="piled in the corner.(Knight)" tags="" position="1000,275" size="100,100">Brutus stares at the shield and sword, baffled. He slowly turns—not to you, but to Orante.
        	“This is not the gear of a guardian,” he says, a slight question in his voice.
        	You feel your heart skip a beat.
        	“Ah…perhaps &lt;%= s.NAME %&gt; was confused. Bought the wrong armor, the wrong weapons. It is awfully loud in the smithy, you know. Easy to mishear an order. A mistake. No more than that,” Orante assures him.
        	“Of course. Just a little mistake.” Brutus nods, satisfied with this answer. “We can sort this out when we return after our adventure.”
        	You want to say, “No, we really cannot,” but you bite your tongue.
        	“But how…the skills…how will &lt;%= s.NAME %&gt; use a guardian’s skills with the wrong weapons?” Orante asks.
        	Brutus waves the question away.
        	“It is just one day. It may be a bit difficult, but I am sure &lt;name&gt; can work through it. Right, &lt;%= s.NAME %&gt;?”
        	“Sure,” you say quickly. Anything to be allowed to use your desired weapons.
 
        	After everyone has geared up and filled their bags with potions and rations, your party leaves the guild hall, and embarks on your [[first adventure.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="133" name="look back at Brutus." tags="" position="1000,525" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Let me check.” Brutus says as he slings his pack off his shoulder, tossing it into the sand with a soft thud.  He digs around for a few moments before pulling out the same scroll you had seen before.  “According to this, there’s a cave just up the beach full of goblins. Minions of Ye Olde Evil, of course. Just have to eliminate the little buggers. Ought to be easy.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Then what are we waiting for?”  Orante turns north and begins walking. “I can see the cave from here.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You all jog to catch up with Orante before settling into a formation, with Brutus in front, you just behind, and Orante and Incerta following closely behind. As you approach the entrance to the cave, the smell of rotting meat and unwashed bodies slams into you.  You nearly jump out of your skin as a soft voice spits out a single word with as much venom as it can muster. “Goblins.”  Incerta says, as if the word alone leaves a [[bad taste in her mouth.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="134" name="bad taste in her mouth." tags="" position="1000,650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus draws his sword and prepares his shield, bouncing on the balls of his feet, eager for a battle. Orante opens her book and its pages begin flipping by themselves. Incerta quietly draws a dagger and pulls the hood up on her cloak, seeming to melt into the darkness. You hastily draw your own weapons, more than a little nervous about your [[first fight.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="135" name="first fight." tags="" position="1000,775" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You hear a cackling coming from up above you as four small shapes drop down from a ledge, each drawing curved swords with notches all along them. As they draw themselves to their full height of four feet, you realize they are goblins.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The one closest to the the group sneers at you, exposing his yellow crooked teeth.  “Well, well, well. What do we have here? A little band of adventurers looking to stop us? Pathetic. That one looks like they’re gonna piss their britches.”  He says, pointing his sword towards you.  “Well then, shall we get this [[slaughter over with?”]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	&lt; If win.&gt;  As the last goblin falls to the ground, Brutus takes a cloth from his pocket and wipes his blade off, grimacing at the smears the black goblin blood leaves.  “Filthy creatures.  &lt;If did guardian skills&gt; “You tried your best, &lt;name&gt;. I am sure you will get the hang of it soon. Just takes a little practice.” His large hand claps you on the back, accompanied by a loud chuckle, [[silenced with a sharp shush from Orante.-&gt;move deeper]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	&lt; If used other skills&gt; Brutus gives you an appraising look. “Not too shabby, &lt;name&gt;.  You seemed to handle yourself alright, even in spite of those...wrong weapons.  Still, it’ll be good to get you your proper gear and [[see what you really can do.”-&gt;move deeper]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="137" name="move deeper" tags="" position="1000,1150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	As he congratulates you, your group moves deeper into the dank cave, the sound of the waves growing quieter behind you as you go further and further. Eventually, your eyes strain to make out more than the faintest of shapes. As you continue, your ears strain as small scrabbling sounds enter them. You chalk it up to rats, and nothing more. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Orante gasps slightly in shock. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Oh, wait, you guys can’t see. My apologies.” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	As she raises her hand, a globe of light slowly twinkling into existence. As it casts its light over the dark recesses of the cave, it illuminates three goblins hiding in the shadows.  Both groups stare at each other for a few moments before the goblins charge with a [[horrifying shriek.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="138" name="horrifying shriek." tags="" position="1125,1275" size="100,100">[[FIGHT 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="139" name="FIGHT 2" tags="" position="1000,1400" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;if win&gt;  As you defeat the goblins, a fourth one darts out of the shadows and runs farther into the cave.  As your group races after him, you hear a bellowing voice come from deeper in the cave.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Come here, little adventurers! Faster, faster! Gorn has been looking for a snack,” the gravelly voice booms. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	As you look towards Brutus for an answer, you swear his face goes slightly pale. Odd. Didn’t he say this would be easy? As you creep forward into the cave, you see a massive figure standing before you, its back facing towards you and covered in a dark yellow hair. As it turns, you see the hair covers its entire body, with squinting, brutish eyes peering out of a hair-covered face marked with two large tusks jutting out from its bottom lip. “There you are,” the bugbear growls, hoisting its spiked club onto its shoulder. “Gorn was just about to come [[find you.”]]
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;if win&gt; As Gorn falls to the ground, dead, Brutus lets out a loud cheer. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“We did it! We showed those ugly bastards! Now let’s get out of here.”  
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Orante puts her hand on your shoulder in a show of appreciation as your party walks out of the cave, on guard for any more goblins or bugbears.  When you reach the opening and can finally see the sky again, you all let out a collective sigh of relief and sit in the sand, taking a breather before heading back to Cysa.

Moments later, you awake.

	You pass an orc woman entertaining a small circle of other adventurers—her party, no doubt. She is impossibly tall and radiates raw strength, her muscles flexing and rippling with every gesture. You eye the massive axe sitting at her side in awe. The curve of the blade almost seems to grin at you, and you wonder how many foul monsters have met their end at its edge. The orc woman catches you gazing at her weapon, and her face splits into a grin of its own, lips curling around her protruding fangs. You hurry away, heart hammering—not from fear, but from {sheer giddiness.} You always knew knights were armored titans of pure power, cleaving and smashing and beheading their foes, but you had never seen a real one before, never realized how palpable their strength was, [[how awesome they looked.]]

	As you walk down the hall, you catch sight of an elvish man leafing through a thick tome as he paces before an empty bowl. He is slender and raven-haired, his narrow eyes squinting at whatever is scrawled across the delicate, yellowed paper. The book itself, bound in leather and falling apart, hardly looks impressive—but there is something arcane about it, something ancient and tantalizingly mysterious. It almost seems to whisper to you, to promise you that all that can be known of this world and the next lies just another page-turn away, if only you would read it. You feel as if your very soul yearns to plumb its pages for knowledge. After all, what is knowledge, if not power?
	The elf suddenly raises a hand, contorting his fingers into curious gestures, his lips moving as he chants under his breath. Lightning gathers in his palm, a crackling ball of knotted energy, just on the verge of breaking free. And it does—break [[free, that is.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="145" name="It’s just, it isn’t… you.(Rogue)" tags="" position="275,3525" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	As you walk down the hall, you notice a dwarvish man idling against a pillar, absentmindedly spinning his dagger in his hand. At his side he carries a wicked-looking rapier, and a longbow rests at his feet. Before him, stretched out on a bench, is a leather bandolier carrying an assortment of glass jars and vials; some hold a fine black powder, others carry sloshing liquids, and one even appears to contain a tiny ball of lightning that bounces angrily between the walls of its prison. You slow your stride, mesmerized by the intricate patterns the dwarf carves in the air as he twirls and tosses his dagger. You always knew rogues were the most versatile of the roles, but only now can you truly appreciate the lethal bouquet of gadgets and trickery they arm themselves with. You can almost see yourself dashing about the outskirts of a chaotic skirmish, tossing those glass grenades into the fray, unleashing sudden gouts of flame, blanketing your foes in unnatural darkness—and then sneaking in when they’re most distracted and introducing [[their heart to your blade.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="146" name="how awesome they looked." tags="" position="25,3650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Excitement overtakes you as you imagine wielding an axe of your own. How satisfying it will feel, to grip its leather hilt, to feel the sheer ferocity of that weapon. How will you look in a winged helmet—or perhaps you will look better with horns? No, horns are so typical. Should you hold a buckler or go for a full kite shield? And what about the armor? Nothing too ornamental, but you don’t want to look too plain, either. You entertain the idea of lions on the pauldrons. Or perhaps roses swirling down the breastplate—an homage to Cysa itself, this wonderful city?
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Mind spinning, [[you hurry forward]], more eager than ever to reach the Quest-Givers’ counter. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="147" name="free, that is." tags="" position="150,3650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	 With a loud crack, a stray bolt flings itself from the mage’s palm and smashes into the bowl, sending fragments of wood flying. There are several irate shouts from nearby adventurers. The mage apologizes sheepishly, tucks the tome under his arm, and begins cleaning up his mess. A few people look annoyed; some are vaguely amused. You, however, are {utterly enthralled.} You always knew mages were mere fingertips away from accessing the primordial power of the elements themselves, but you never knew the true reach of their knowledge, the extent of their skill. Imagine! Commanding the might of storms! Taming the ravenous fire! What could be better than that? Your fingertips can already feel the dusty cover of your own grimoire, your hands already twitching out the ghosts of spells.
	&lt;/div&gt;

	Is there anything more satisfying?
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The dwarf notices you watching, but rather than stop or turn away, he gives you a wink and a lopsided grin. Before you can wonder why, he suddenly turns and flings the dagger. It whistles through the air—and smashes a clay cup across the hall, startling the orc man just about to drink from it. The orc gives a roar and leaps to his feet, but the dwarvish rogue has already vanished, along with all of his gear. You scurry off before the orc sees you, but you can hardly hide your giddy grin as [[you hurry forward]], more eager than ever to reach the Quest-Givers’ counter.

You shift slightly, peering between Brutus and Orante, to watch the rogue slip on a cloak and pull its hood over her head. You cannot help but feel a little jealous.
