	You enter an empty booth—there aren’t many of them left—and sit down. A quill and a piece of parchment sit on the counter before you. You bend over the paper, peering down at the thin scrawl of writing marred by too many fancy flourishes.

	You had dreamed of venturing to the mystical land of Eorundem ever since you were a child. Your [[father]] would tell you grand tales of its rivers teeming with lost treasures, of the magical creatures that roamed its verdant hills, of the fathomless caverns that shivered with beastly roars, and of the endless forests that bristled with magic and seemed to whisper at night. And who could forget the ancient foe that plagued the land every several years? The [[stories]] of [[Ye Olde Evil’s]] repeated vanquishing were among your favourites. Now that you have come of age, it is no surprise you’ve chosen to set off for Eorundem, your [[mother’s]] blessing still lingering on your cheek. [[It is time for an adventure.]]

You spend your days with wide, awestruck eyes as the everchanging [[landscape]] rolls languidly by; at night you watch strange constellations chase each other across the sky. Your travels are briefly halted by a stampede of three-headed, fire-breathing buffalo, and two wagons losing their wheels to mischievous gremlins—and for three days straight a deluge of strange rain coats the rivers in fine silver. However, these slight mishaps only further whet your appetite for adventure, and [[your anticipation only grows.]]

	The sky seems boundless out here. It is as if the very world has opened itself up. The horizon has never seemed so far away before, and nothing—no village huts or crowding trees—breaks the great expanse of blue overhead. In the distance, you can see stone temples carved from the mountain range, glistening with ice. The lush meadows stretch in all directions from the dusty road, their grasses swelling and rolling in the wind, their slopes flecked with flowers. White stags with six pink eyes watch your procession from the safety of the forests, but they scatter when something roars from deep within the woods. [[Back-&gt;It is time for an adventure.]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	“My trade. I am a merchant,” she replies. “My village to the east makes a special butter from the gossamer worms that grow in the nearby caverns. It’s considered a delicacy in Cysa, often spread over stuffed bread.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[“That sounds…lovely.”] It does not, in fact, sound lovely at all.

	&lt;div&gt;
	She laughs.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I know it hardly sounds appetizing, but truly, the creamy sweetness of gossamer worm against savory stuffed bread is a step and a half from heaven.” She giggles. “On special occasions, we make it with [[moon slugs as well.]]”

You are not the only excited one; the air just about crackles with energy that night, and suppertime chatter is particularly loud and laughter-filled. Having slopped a [[small helping]] of meat stew on your platter, you take a seat near a [[young woman]] with kind eyes. You have seen her here and there throughout the past weeks.

	&lt;/div&gt;

	“Tell me, then, what brings you to Cysa?” she asks.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;

	“A &lt;%= s.ROLE %&gt; is always in demand somewhere, I’m sure,” she says.

And then it goes quiet, and all you can hear are soft footsteps from the surrounding shadows.

	and fall
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	and fall
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	and the stone itself opens up to swallow you whole
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	trapping you, frozen, unchanging and unyielding, your arms clasped 
around a [shield]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	the only thing you did not drop when you plummeted
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[[down]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
