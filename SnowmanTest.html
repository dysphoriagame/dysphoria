	You enter an empty booth—there aren’t many of them left—and sit down. A quill and a piece of parchment sit on the counter before you. You bend over the paper, peering down at the thin scrawl of writing marred by too many fancy flourishes.

	&lt;div&gt;
	You have dreamed of venturing to the mystical land of Eorundem ever since you were a child. Your [father] would tell you grand tales of its rivers teeming with lost treasures, of the magical creatures that roamed its verdant hills. Your [mother] treated you with legends of the fathomless caverns that shivered with beastly roars, of the endless forests that bristled with magic and seemed to whisper at night. And who could forget the ancient foe that plagued the land every several years? The [stories] of [Ye Olde Evil’s] repeated vanquishing are among your favourites.
	&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	However, stories alone did not bring you to Eorundem, nor did rumors of the ancient foe’s return. Nay, the catalyst that truly sparked your thirst for adventure was a [[simple flyer]], pinned to the door of the village pub.
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="father" tags="" position="150,25" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt; A good man. As dedicated to the smithy as he is to his family.

&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="stories" tags="" position="275,25" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Your father knew many stories. Ballad of Bhavulthrolo, wandering bard who serenaded a mountain until it moved out of his way, if only to escape his horrendous singing. Legend of Llyr Windeater, Prince of Kites, who wore a paper cape of many colours that granted him the gift of flight. Song of Seluria, intrepid adventurer who defeated Ye Olde Evil seven times singlehandedly. That is, Seluria only had one hand. 
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Ye Olde Evil’s" tags="" position="400,25" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt; Evil incarnate. The name rather gives it away, doesn’t it?

&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="mother" tags="" position="525,25" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt; A kind woman. Her hands have mended your childhood cuts and scrapes as deftly as they have sewn clothes back together.

	&lt;div&gt;
	The guild hall is near impossible to miss. Heralded by broad, sweeping stairs, the hall is made of burnished wood, the crest of its roof curving in an arc, its walls bulging outwards before tapering sharply in the back. In fact, the more you marvel at it, the more it looks like a massive ship that has been cut in half and turned upside down in the middle of the city. Its broad oaken doors are flanked by two rippling banners, each bearing the crest of Cysa: a sapphire rose against white.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	After steeling yourself and taking another deep breath, you jog up the final steps and, with several great pushes, barely manage to open the heavy front doors and [[slip inside.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="You suspect magic." tags="" position="25,650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Directly ahead, at the end of the deep blue carpet that rolls down the length of the hall, you can see the candlelit counters you always dreamed of but never thought you would see. One day, at those wooden counters, in those narrow booths, you will apply for an adventure with a [Quest-Giver.] However, while the Quest-Givers’ counters appear to be closed today—the window shutters are drawn shut—long lines of wild-eyed newcomers stream from the booths themselves.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    “Register for the guild and join an adventuring party here!” a guild member shouts over the din, gesturing to the line. You hastily add yourself to the nearest trail of recruits, your excitement nearly strangled by your nervousness. You are so tantalizingly close to fulfilling the dreams of your childhood; the thought alone is enough to make you dizzy. You can hardly wait to declare your role—the [[most important part.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="die alongside you." tags="" position="25,1950" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Your favourite story was the Legend of Benevere, a brilliant and courageous &lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;. In his last adventure, his party took on a chimera and greatly underestimated its strength. Benevere watched his party members fall, one by one, around him, until only he and one other companion remained—the mage Ealanora, who alone had the power to renew those who had fallen. In an act of legendary bravery, Benevere unleashed every skill he knew, used every weapon he had, employed every technique of combat that he had ever learned, in a final effort to distract the chimera and allow Ealanora to cast her spell. He sustained great injury—injuries that would never truly heal—but his job was done; Ealanora brought their party back from the brink of death, and together, they defeated their [[monstrous foe.]]

You look back at the parchment. Now you will be placed into a party—a group of fiercely loyal comrades who will fight, dine, live, and die alongside you. This is as important as declaring your role; most likely, you will spend the rest of your adventuring days alongside your party. You watch the parchment, the hastily scribbled “&lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;” {lingering at the top…} but instead of assigning you to a party, the paper suddenly erases what you wrote. “&lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;” disappears. And the parchment continues [[writing itself.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="writing itself." tags="" position="25,2325" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
“And your party role shall be…guardian.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You stare at the paper in {confusion.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	{Guardian?}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Perhaps your handwriting, in your haste, was too difficult to read and confused the parchment. Perhaps this was an error, some sort of magical malfunction. This probably happens often, right? Magic was a finnicky thing, after all. Of course. You grab the quill, scratch out “guardian,” and [[once again write &lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE %&gt;-&gt;once again write]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="once again write" tags="" position="25,2450" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Your writing disappears—a little quicker this time—and is stubbornly replaced by “guardian.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	{What?}

	&lt;div&gt;
	{No.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	{No.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Surely this is some sort of mistake? It has to be! You are not sure what is happening, but you know this cannot be right. You cross out “guardian” and write “&lt;%= s.CHOSENROLE %&gt;” once more, this time more slowly, taking care to define every curve and line of every letter. There. No room for error there, surely. [[You are certain this time it will accept your desired role.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="You are certain this time it will accept your desired role." tags="" position="25,2575" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	You’ve barely finished the last letter before the first one begins disappearing, emptiness eating up the ink, “guardian” rewriting itself back onto the paper. Your confusion has given way to anxiety; you can feel the first sharp pangs of panic shorten your breathing, your mind smothered by frustration. Something is wrong. Something is so very wrong. Why isn’t it letting you choose your role? Why is this stupid scrap of yellowed paper trying to stop you? Are you doing something wrong? You can’t be doing something wrong! There’s nothing wrong about this—everyone gets to choose their own role, you’re not doing anything out of the ordinary, this is normal—but this isn’t normal, it obviously isn’t, or [[it would let you choose and it isn’t—]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	“And your party role shall be guardian,” the parchment reads. And you feel a twinge of anger, a soft snap inside, as if something has given way in your heart.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	[[Ask help of the person in the neighboring booth.]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	You inhale deeply and steady your breathing. Anger will hardly help you here. Instead, you stand up abruptly and walk over to the next booth. A young, gangly fellow is seated there, filling out his own paper. He looks up.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Are you having trouble declaring your role as well?” you ask, trying to put on a pleasant face.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	He frowns.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Declare?” he asks. [[“What do ye mean, declare?”]]

&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Tear the paper apart." tags="" position="150,2825" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The parchment resists all attempts at mangling. You half expected as much, but this hardly assuages your rage. It’s ridiculous. It’s utterly inane. Is this not the Adventurers’ Guild, famed and admired and built upon the fortunes of the city itself? How can it allow for such botched operations, such archaic and dysfunctional procedures? This isn’t the Dark Ages. A guild of this size should have this nonsense figured out by now!
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	After attempting to stab the word “guardian” out of the parchment several times, you finally stand up and walk over to the next booth. A young, gangly fellow is seated there, filling out his own paper. He looks up—and balks at the [[murderous look on your face.]]

	“Of course it cannae let ye. Roles are assigned. Ye don’t get tae choose them.” He taps his quill on the scroll before him. “It’s a powerful magic, I hear. Looks deep, tae the very essence of yer being.” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Your heart almost seems to choke on its own ire, throbbing with fury in the pit of your chest.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I takes it ye don’t come from ‘round these here parts?” the boy asks tentatively.
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;
	He looks a bit frightened by this aggressive display. You admit, you feel a bit guilty; it’s hardly his fault, there’s no need to vent your frustrations on him.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Declare?” he asks. “What do ye mean, declare?”
“I want to be a &lt;s.CHOSENROLE&gt;, so I tried to write it on the parchment, but it won’t let me!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The youth looks confused. You don’t know why he looks so bewildered. [[How does he think you feel?!]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	“Well, if ye were born in Eorundem, yer role would have been declared the moment ye left yer mother’s womb.

You’re furious. No, not quite furious; you’re too distraught to be simply furious. It’s a different sort of emotion that you feel—an anger that was conceived of bewilderment and born of panic. Yes, you’re angry. Angry at yourself for being so [emotional]. Angry at yourself for being so [foolish]. Angry at whatever “ancient magics” that now usurp your dreams and dictate your life.

	You bite your lip and attempt to return his grin. Brutus’s smile broadens.

	“Hear that?” he calls to his other party members. “We have ourselves a guardian at last!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;

	Orante claps politely. Only silence from Incerta.

	“We’ve been in need of a guardian for some time now,” Orante explains. “We’re so glad you’re a guardian. If we had gotten another &lt;%=s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;, Brutus might’ve had a fit. We hardly need any more &lt;%=s.CHOSENROLE%&gt;s.”

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Of course. Another &lt;%=s.CHOSENROLE%&gt; would be useless,” you agree. The words feel bitter on your tongue. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The elf smiles beatifically at you, and then beckons you inside. What an odd gesture. It’s as if you’ve passed her test, proven that you are normal, that you are one of them. You wonder if she would still invite you into their world if she knew what sort of [[imposter you are.]]

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You might be emotional and foolish, but you certainly are not a coward. Of course it is the right time. It always is. And if you don’t sort this out now—if you don’t address the problem directly and immediately—it will soon be too late. You cannot very well mention something like this out on the battlefield, right? No. {This has to be done now.}
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“I’m not sure about that, actually,” {you begin to say.} But before you can continue, Brutus cuts you off with a wave of his hand.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Whatever it is, it can wait. You need food, recruit. You’ll need a day of good food before you go on your first adventure,” he says. “How do you like the sound of that, eh? [[First adventure?]]

	“I remember my first adventure. I was a green lad then, more nerves and excitement than muscle. The last bit has changed, obviously.” He flexes again. You hear a seam rip somewhere.

	“First day nerves, eh? We shall bring extra provisions, then. Nothing like a good day of explorin’ and fightin’ to stir up an appetite. And trust me, you’ll need plenty of food if you ever wish to look as I do.” He doesn’t flex this time, but he does roll his sleeves up, exposing the corded muscles running up the length of his forearms, the skin leathery beneath swathes of shiny scars.

With that, she slips into the crowd, melting into the patchwork sea of cloaks and capes and shadows [[before your very eyes.]] &lt;If role is rogue&gt; You watch in silent wonder.

	Incerta mumbles something; a moment later, she slinks out of the room, a pack slung over one shoulder. She heads down the hallway without a glance at you.

	The marketplace has calmed somewhat since this morning. Citizens mill about, tearing at skewers of grilled meats, picking at loaves of fruit-encrusted bread with their bare hands, carrying pails of milk and water back to their homes. The air is filled with idle chatter and generous amounts of laughter. Nearly every shop is open today. The empty vials, bottles, and jars strung from the eaves of the [[apothecary shop]] clink together in the gentle wind. The [[smithy]] belches black clouds of smoke. The grocer’s and the mentor’s shops are closed.

	The smithy greets you with a blast of hot air and the rhythmic din of metal upon metal. The forge is stained by a hundred vermillion hues, the stone walls colourless without the violent flashes of fire and brilliant sprays of sparks. The furnace flares and growls in the back, illuminating the apprentices working at the anvils. Weapons and armors hang in rows against the walls, some sorely in need of repair, some polished and gleaming.

	*Guardian.* He called you guardian. And how heavily those words weigh upon your shoulders, and everything inside you sinks, coalescing into one solid mass in your chest. You grip the guardian’s scepter, swinging it around a bit. You heft the heavy shield, tying the straps around your forearm. It feels…wrong. This isn’t how you imagined it. This isn’t what you wanted.

	“I swung by the Quest-Givers this mornin’ and got ourselves a quest. It’s an easy one. A good introduction for our newest member,” he continues. “We’re to clear out a beach near Cysa. They’ve been infested with Ye Olde Evil’s baddies as of late.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Sounds delightful,” Orante murmurs as she follows Brutus inside. Incerta nods silently from her own bed.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Perfect place to teach you how to use your skills and wield your weapons. Speaking of…” Brutus looks at your gear, &lt;a onclick=&quot;Passage.checkChosenRole()&quot;&gt;piled in the corner.&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus stares at the shield and sword, baffled. He slowly turns—not to you, but to Orante.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    “This is not the gear of a guardian,” he says, a slight question in his voice.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    You feel your heart skip a beat.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    “Ah…perhaps &lt;%= s.NAME %&gt; was confused. Bought the wrong armor, the wrong weapons. It is awfully loud in the smithy, you know. Easy to mishear an order. A mistake. No more than that,” Orante assures him.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    “Of course. Just a little mistake.” Brutus nods, satisfied with this answer. “We can sort this out when we return after our adventure.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    You want to say, “No, we really cannot,” but you bite your tongue.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    “But how…the skills…how will &lt;%= s.NAME %&gt; use a guardian’s skills with the wrong weapons?” Orante asks.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    [[Brutus waves the question away.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="85" name="look back at Brutus." tags="" position="1375,650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Let me check.” Brutus says as he slings his pack off his shoulder, tossing it into the sand with a soft thud.  He digs around for a few moments before pulling out the same scroll you had seen before.  “According to this, there’s a cave just up the beach full of goblins. Minions of Ye Olde Evil, of course. Just have to eliminate the little buggers. Ought to be easy.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Then what are we waiting for?”  Orante turns north and begins walking. “I can see the cave from here.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You all jog to catch up with Orante before settling into a formation, with Brutus in front, you just behind, and Orante and Incerta following closely behind. As you approach the entrance to the cave, the smell of rotting meat and unwashed bodies slams into you.  You nearly jump out of your skin as a soft voice spits out a single word with as much venom as it can muster. “Goblins.”  Incerta says, as if the word alone leaves a [[bad taste in her mouth.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="86" name="bad taste in her mouth." tags="" position="1375,775" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus draws his sword and prepares his shield, bouncing on the balls of his feet, eager for a battle. Orante opens her book and its pages begin flipping by themselves. Incerta quietly draws a dagger and pulls the hood up on her cloak, seeming to melt into the darkness. You hastily draw your own weapons, more than a little nervous about your [[first fight.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="87" name="first fight." tags="" position="1375,900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You hear a cackling coming from up above you as four small shapes drop down from a ledge, each drawing curved swords with notches all along them. As they draw themselves to their full height of four feet, you realize they are goblins.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The one closest to the the group sneers at you, exposing his yellow crooked teeth.  “Well, well, well. What do we have here? A little band of adventurers looking to stop us? Pathetic. That one looks like they’re gonna piss their britches.”  He says, pointing his sword towards you.  “Well then, shall we get this [[slaughter over with?”]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	&lt; If win.&gt;  As the last goblin falls to the ground, Brutus takes a cloth from his pocket and wipes his blade off, grimacing at the smears the black goblin blood leaves.  “Filthy creatures.  &lt;If did guardian skills&gt; “You tried your best, &lt;name&gt;. I am sure you will get the hang of it soon. Just takes a little practice.” His large hand claps you on the back, accompanied by a loud chuckle, [[silenced with a sharp shush from Orante.-&gt;move deeper]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	&lt; If used other skills&gt; Brutus gives you an appraising look. “Not too shabby, &lt;name&gt;.  You seemed to handle yourself alright, even in spite of those...wrong weapons.  Still, it’ll be good to get you your proper gear and [[see what you really can do.”-&gt;move deeper]]

&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="89" name="move deeper" tags="" position="1375,1275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	As he congratulates you, your group moves deeper into the dank cave, the sound of the waves growing quieter behind you as you go further and further. Eventually, your eyes strain to make out more than the faintest of shapes. As you continue, your ears strain as small scrabbling sounds enter them. You chalk it up to rats, and nothing more. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Orante gasps slightly in shock. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Oh, wait, you guys can’t see. My apologies.” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	As she raises her hand, a globe of light slowly twinkling into existence. As it casts its light over the dark recesses of the cave, it illuminates three goblins hiding in the shadows.  Both groups stare at each other for a few moments before the goblins charge with a [[horrifying shriek.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="90" name="horrifying shriek." tags="" position="1500,1400" size="100,100">[[FIGHT 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="91" name="FIGHT 2" tags="" position="1375,1525" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;if win&gt;  As you defeat the goblins, a fourth one darts out of the shadows and runs farther into the cave.  As your group races after him, you hear a bellowing voice come from deeper in the cave.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Come here, little adventurers! Faster, faster! Gorn has been looking for a snack,” the gravelly voice booms. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	As you look towards Brutus for an answer, you swear his face goes slightly pale. Odd. Didn’t he say this would be easy? As you creep forward into the cave, you see a massive figure standing before you, its back facing towards you and covered in a dark yellow hair. As it turns, you see the hair covers its entire body, with squinting, brutish eyes peering out of a hair-covered face marked with two large tusks jutting out from its bottom lip. “There you are,” the bugbear growls, hoisting its spiked club onto its shoulder. “Gorn was just about to come [[find you.”]]
	&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;if win&gt; As Gorn falls to the ground, dead, Brutus lets out a loud cheer. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“We did it! We showed those ugly bastards! Now let’s get out of here.”  
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Orante puts her hand on your shoulder in a show of appreciation as your party walks out of the cave, on guard for any more goblins or bugbears.  When you reach the opening and can finally see the sky again, you all let out a collective sigh of relief and sit in the sand, taking a breather before heading back to Cysa.

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    “Good quality. Ought to hold up well in a scuffle.” Brutus claps you on the shoulder. “Good work, recruit. Got yourself some fine gear there.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    You shrug and say nothing. You stand to one side as the others gear up, chewing a bread roll over and over in your mouth until it loses all taste, stalling as long as you can until you have no choice but to slip into your own armor.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
    The bulky pauldrons and heavy cuirass of a guardian feel large and awkward on your body. The helm feels lopsided, and the metal greaves make every step a struggle against gravity. The scepter feels foreign in your gauntlets, the buckler straps too loose or too tight no matter how you try to adjust them. Part of you wonders if you will ever be able to wear the armor of [[a guardian comfortably.-&gt;first adventure.]]

    After everyone has geared up and filled their bags with potions and rations, your party leaves the guild hall, and embarks on your [[first adventure.]]   </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="118" name="simple flyer" tags="" position="25,150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	*“Hear ye, hear ye! Ye Olde Evil has returned to the lands of Eorundem once more, unleashing hordes of wicked monsters upon the fair beaches, desecrating the gentle forests with magics most foul, and threatening the great city of Cysa, Flower-by-the-Sea! The Adventurers’ Guild of Cysa is in urgent need of capable youths that have come of age to help combat this threat! Journey to Cysa and join the Guild for adventure, fame, and [[fortune aplenty!”]]*
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="119" name="fortune aplenty!”" tags="" position="25,275" size="100,100">Now, a week of traveling later, you find yourself at last in Cysa, the seaside capital of Eorundem. You quickly learn why Cysa is known as the Flower-by-the-Sea; the city is designed to mimic a rose and its innumerable folds. Each district is a petal, each road following the intricate pattern of the flower’s irregular whorls. It is the very center of the rose—the close cluster of petals—that holds the heart of Cysa: the marketplace, and more importantly, the [[Adventurers’ Guild.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="120" name="slip inside." tags="" position="25,525" size="100,100">The guild hall bristles with activity. To one side, adventurers are bustling up and down rows of long, wooden tables, setting out platters of food and fitting gear for the [new recruits] that sit surrounded by their party members. Adventurers not preoccupied with newcomers huddle together over maps stretched across the dining tables, discussing strategies and drawing out plans of attack. To the other side, rickety staircases spiral up to the barracks; adventurers lean against the banisters, drinking from steaming mugs, watching the commotion downstairs. At ground level, several open doors reveal training rooms, armories, granaries, spare storage rooms, and the stables. Your mind spins; the guild hall looks large enough from the outside, but the inside is somehow far more expansive. [[You suspect magic.]]  </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="121" name="New Recruits" tags="" position="150,525" size="100,100">You can tell they are new because they look just as dazed, awed, and entirely unequipped for adventuring as you do.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="122" name="Quest-Giver" tags="" position="150,650" size="100,100">Wizened men and women who have seen sunrise and storm aplenty, and have survived them all.

	&lt;div&gt;
	As the line of recruits slowly lurches down the hall, you gaze at the adventurers who have gathered this morning. An elf ranger sits with her back against the wall, busily restringing her bow, rubbing the elegant weapon down with oil. You had a childhood friend who always took the role of ranger when you played together. He found the role fun, but you never took any interest in it. You spot a dwarf guardian cleaning his buckler, scepter resting beside him. Another role you never found particularly exciting. In fact, of all the roles, you like the guardian the least. Not that there is anything inherently wrong with guardians. It’s just, it isn’t… you. You would much rather be a…
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
[[Knight, mighty and proud.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
[[Mage, devastating from a distance.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
[[Rogue, cunning and swift.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="124" name="Knight, mighty and proud." tags="" position="25,900" size="100,100">You scan the hall for a knight, eyes at last alighting on an orc woman entertaining a small circle of adventurers—her party, no doubt. She is impossibly tall and radiates raw strength, her muscles flexing and rippling with every gesture. You eye the massive axe sitting at her side in awe. The curve of the blade almost seems to grin at you, and you wonder how many foul monsters have met their end at its edge. The orc woman catches you gazing at her weapon, and her face splits into a grin of its own, lips curling around her protruding fangs. You hurry away, heart hammering—not from fear, but from [[sheer giddiness.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="125" name="Mage, devastating from a distance." tags="" position="150,900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You scan the hall for a mage, and catch sight of an elvish man leafing through a thick tome as he paces before an empty bowl. He is slender and raven-haired, his narrow eyes squinting at whatever is scrawled across the delicate, yellowed paper. The book itself, bound in leather and falling apart, hardly looks impressive—but there is something arcane about it, something ancient and tantalizingly mysterious. It almost seems to whisper to you, to promise you that all that can be known of this world and the next lies just another page-turn away, if only you would read it. You feel as if your very soul yearns to plumb its pages for knowledge. After all, what is knowledge, if not power? 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	The elf suddenly raises a hand, contorting his fingers into curious gestures, his lips moving as he chants under his breath. Lightning gathers in his palm, a crackling ball of knotted energy, just on the verge of [[breaking free]].
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="126" name="Rogue, cunning and swift." tags="" position="275,900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	You scan the hall for a rogue until you notice a dwarvish man idling against a pillar, absentmindedly spinning his dagger in his hand. At his side he carries a wicked-looking rapier. Before him, stretched out on a bench, is a leather bandolier carrying an assortment of glass jars and vials; some hold a fine black powder, others carry sloshing liquids, and one even appears to contain a tiny ball of lightning that bounces angrily between the walls of its prison. You slow your stride, mesmerized by the intricate patterns the dwarf carves in the air as he twirls and tosses his dagger. You always knew rogues were the most versatile of the roles, but only now can you truly appreciate the lethal bouquet of gadgets and trickery they arm themselves with. You can almost see yourself dashing about the outskirts of a chaotic skirmish, tossing those glass grenades into the fray, unleashing sudden gouts of flame, blanketing your foes in unnatural darkness—and then sneaking in when they’re most distracted and introducing their heart to your blade. [[Is there anything more satisfying?]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="127" name="sheer giddiness." tags="" position="25,1025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You always knew knights were armored titans of pure power, cleaving and smashing and beheading their foes, but you had never seen a real one before, never realized how palpable their strength was, how *awesome* they looked. Excitement overtakes you as you imagine wielding an axe of your own. How satisfying it will feel, to grip its leather hilt, to feel the sheer ferocity of that weapon. How will you look in a winged helmet—or perhaps you will look better with horns? No, horns are so typical. Should you hold a buckler or go for a full kite shield? And what about the armor? Nothing too ornamental, but you don’t want to look too *plain,* either. You entertain the idea of lions on the pauldrons. Or perhaps roses swirling down the breastplate—an homage to Cysa itself, this wonderful city?
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Mind spinning, [[you hurry forward]] as the line shifts, more eager than ever to reach the Quest-Givers’ counter.
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="128" name="breaking free" tags="" position="150,1025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	And it does—break free, that is. With a loud crack, a stray bolt flings itself from the mage’s palm and smashes into the bowl, sending fragments of wood flying. There are several irate shouts from nearby adventurers. The mage apologizes sheepishly, tucks the tome under his arm, and begins cleaning up his mess. A few people look annoyed; some are vaguely amused. You, however, are {utterly enthralled.} You always knew mages were mere fingertips away from accessing the primordial power of the elements themselves, but you never knew the true reach of their knowledge, the extent of their skill. Imagine! Commanding the might of storms! Taming the ravenous fire! What could be better than that? Your fingertips can already feel the dusty cover of your own grimoire, your hands already twitching out the ghosts of spells.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;

	The dwarf notices you watching, but rather than stop or turn away, he gives you a wink and a lopsided grin. Before you can wonder why, he suddenly turns and flings the dagger. It whistles through the air—and smashes a clay cup across the hall, startling the orc man just about to drink from it. The orc gives a roar and leaps to his feet, but the dwarvish rogue has already vanished, along with all of his gear. You turn around before the orc sees you, but you can hardly hide your giddy grin as [[you hurry forward]], more eager than ever to reach the Quest-Givers’ counter.
