	Like so many other aspiring adventurers, you find yourself newly-arrived in the Adventurers’ Guild hall, nearly lost in the sea of recruits spilling in through the doors. The guild hall bristles with activity, the air taut with urgency. Guildmates bustle wild-eyed newcomers into whatever gear is on hand, veteran adventurers shouting over the din— “Our party needs another ranger, find us a ranger why don’t you!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Our party has an opening for a knight!” 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Where is our guardian? Ye Olde Evil’s minions will attack any moment now!”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Register for the guild and join an adventuring party here!” a narrow-faced guild master calls, standing on a table and waving a handful of scrolls. Pulled along by the jostling chaos, you end up at the front of the line. The guild member [[peers down at you.]]

	&lt;div&gt;
	“Splendid. You can take this one off my hands, then,” the guild master sniffs. He scrawls something on the scroll and gives it to you.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“&lt;%= s.NAME %&gt;,” it says. “Guardian.”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	No.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Surely this is some sort of mistake? It has to be. You thought you were allowed to choose your own role. Is that not how it usually goes? You journey to a new and fantastical realm, you declare your role, and then you join a party and you all go on grand adventures together—is that not how it usually works? Is that not how the stories always go? 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Welcome to the party, &lt;name&gt;,” the tall orc says with a friendly grin, guiding you out of the line and towards a nearby table, where a slender elf woman and a hooded human woman sit, unperturbed by the commotion [[surrounding them.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="speaking over you." tags="" position="25,900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Lucky for you, younglin’, we had some spare guardian gear lyin’ around. Save you a trip to the smithy. It ought to fit, more or less.” Brutus grabs a long robe, a buckler, and a scepter from under the table and drops them into your arms. They are hardly heavy, and yet you nearly stumble beneath the sudden weight, more out of shock than anything else. You stare at the bundle in your arms. He simply gave you a guardian’s gear? You weren’t even allowed a choice? 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“You can buy better gear once you have the gold for it. For now, this will do,” Brutus continues.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	You try to nod and smile—he is, after all, only trying to be helpful—but in the back of your mind, you are already plotting to exchange this coarse robe and useless scepter for a proper &lt;%= s.ROLE.toLowerCase() %&gt;’s set of gear.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Suddenly, a loud horn blares [[through the hall.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“And the sulkin’ one is Incerta, our rogue,” Brutus continues. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Incerta says nothing, her dark, hooded eyes fixated on the ground.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“So, this is our new guardian?” Orante asks, studying you with grey eyes, head tilted in curiosity.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Actually, no, I’d like to be—” you begin.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Sure is!” Brutus interjects loudly, [[speaking over you.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="through the hall." tags="" position="25,1025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“And that there is our cue,” Brutus says, grabbing his own sword and shield. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	All around you, parties of adventurers hastily don their gear and begin flooding out of the hall, the deep bellows of the horn echoing off wall and ceiling. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Our cue for what?” you ask as Orante helps you into your robe and fastens your buckler to your arm. The small, round shield grips your forearm, vise-like. The robe is coarse and far too large. 
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus bares his fangs in a wide grin, dark pupils flaring.
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	“Ye Olde Evil’s minions are swarmin’ the beaches just outside of Cysa. Our first quest is to clear them out and defend the city. Now hurry along, no more time for explainin’!”
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
	Before you know it, you are being dragged to the outskirts of the city, embarking on your first adventure not as a &lt;%=s.ROLE.toLowerCase()%&gt;, but [[as a guardian.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="as a guardian." tags="" position="25,1150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	The ocean of adventurers splits upon leaving the guild hall. Half of the parties charge to the drawbridge, prepared to defend against the trolls lurching towards the city gates. Your half hurries to the beaches beyond Cysa’s walls, where goblins are swarming out of makeshift rafts and vessels. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You do your best to keep up with your party, nearly tripping over the hem of your robe, almost tumbling down the crudely hewn stairs that lead down to the beach. The roar of the sea grows deafeningly loud, no longer dampened by city walls, as your party spills out across the blinding white sands.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“There!” Brutus shouts, pointing at a nearby cluster of goblins. The creatures bare their fangs and hiss. “A little somethin’ to warm us up!” 
You hurry after your party as they [[charge.]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="charge." tags="" position="25,1275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus is first into the fray, using his Slash to cleave through the nearest goblin, blood spraying in the wake of his sword. The orc knight gives a triumphant roar, wading further into combat. &lt;if knight&gt; You watch him enviously, imagining what it would be like, to be able to charge into danger so boldly, to be able to wield the brutal power of a sword—to wield anything other than your stupid scepter. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante casts Fireball and hurls the resultant orb of flame at another goblin. The creature shrieks as its cloth armor catches fire, and it flees towards the water. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Incerta slips around the enemies, unnoticed, and plunges her daggers into a goblin archer in the back. She hurriedly disengages. You think you see her briefly bend down near the fallen foe’s quiver and bow, but she straightens [[just as swiftly.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="You use Mend." tags="" position="25,1525" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	You wave your scepter in an attempt to heal Brutus. Your scepter feels heavy and useless in your hands. After a considerable amount of concentration and effort, you manage to deliver a very weak heal. Brutus frowns, clearly not feeling nearly as invigorated as he had hoped. You give him a half-hearted shrug and a weak smile in reply. He grunts and charges back into the thick of battle.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante coughs delicately. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Ah…you might practice that skill a little more,” she suggests.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div hidden class=&quot;mage&quot;&gt;

After a considerable amount of concentration and effort, you think the scepter lights up a little. Brutus glances back at you, frowning. You give him a half-hearted shrug and a weak smile in reply. He grunts and charges back into the thick of battle.

&lt;div&gt;
	“Use [Mend] or [Blind], &lt;s%= s.NAME %&gt;,” Orante urges, already channeling another spell. “Brutus needs your help!”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	[[You use Mend.]] This will heal Brutus&#39; wounds.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

	Brutus uses Shield Bash, violently slamming his kite shield forward. It connects with a goblin’s face, sending the creature flying, dazed, bone and cartilage collapsed by this brutish assault. The last goblin standing shrieks in alarm and begins to scramble away.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante whispers an incantation and twists her fingers above her tome. Ice settles over the fleeing goblin, freezing it in place.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Incerta moves so swiftly, she almost seems to teleport to the frozen goblin, her daggers sliding between its ribs before the creature even has time to react. She steps away as Orante’s Freeze swallows up the rest of its body, leaving an ice statue stained by two [[blooms of crimson.]] 
&lt;div hidden class=&quot;rogue&quot;&gt;
	You watch Incerta enviously, wishing you too could dance with shadows and silence, relying on cunning and dexterity rather than brute strength or finnicky magics.

	Brutus shakes remnants of goblin off his sword and shield, grinning broadly. His chartreuse eyes almost seem to glow with bloodlust.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“What filthy creatures need to be put down next?” he roars. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	A poorly built raft crashes onto the beach nearby, throwing four goblins—two warriors, an archer, and a shaman—free of the thrashing waves. Brutus gives a rumbling bellow and [[rushes towards them.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="rushes towards them." tags="" position="25,1900" size="100,100">
&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus swings his mighty sword at the goblin with a snarl. However, the goblin dances out of the way of the heavy Slash, jeering. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Lucky,” Brutus spits.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Weak,” the goblin sneers, slicing Brutus across the upper arm. The orc knight’s eyes nearly bulge from his head.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante hastily spins another Freeze out of thin air, encasing the offending foe in ice. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Incerta flings a vial from her bandolier at the goblins’ feet. The glass shatters against a rock, and noxious gases rise in a green cloud, poisoning the foes. They cough and gasp, clutching their throats, scurrying away from the fumes.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	It is your turn. You could heal a party member in need, or you could daze the enemy with brilliant light.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	[[You use Mend.-&gt;You use Mend.2]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="You use Mend.2" tags="" position="25,2025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	You take a deep breath, clutching your scepter. You are tempted to simply chuck the useless thing at the nearest goblin’s head. Maybe the buckler too—and why not just smother the goblin in your ugly robe, for good measure?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“A heal, younglin’! I need a heal” Brutus shouts, clutching his arm.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You sigh and try to channel a heal through your scepter. This time, you do manage to heal someone. Unfortunately, that someone is [[not Brutus.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="24" name="You use Blind.2" tags="" position="150,2025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	You take a deep breath, clutching your scepter. You are tempted to simply chuck the useless thing at the nearest goblin’s head. Maybe the buckler too—and why not just smother the goblin in your ugly robe, for good measure?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“A blind, younglin’! Daze these disgustin’ creatures for me!” Brutus shouts, clutching his arm.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You sigh and point your scepter at the goblin warriors, doing your very best to channel Blind. Your scepter glows weakly, before sputtering out altogether. One of the goblins cackles at you. You grit your teeth; now you really want to throw your scepter through its head. Or, better yet, use &lt;%= s.ROLE.toLowerCase() %&gt;’s gear to slay it like a proper &lt;%= s.ROLE.toLowerCase() %&gt;, instead of trying to make do with this nonsense!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus hefts his shield, spitting on the frozen goblin warrior before advancing [[on the second.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="not Brutus." tags="" position="25,2150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	“I did not require aid,” Orante murmurs.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The goblin archer lets loose an arrow. It grazes Orante’s shoulder, leaving a thin line of blood in its wake. Your Mend slowly closes the small wound, restoring her pale skin. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Preemptive healing?” you suggest.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	She purses her lips, giving you a highly skeptical look.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus hefts his shield, spitting on the frozen goblin warrior before advancing [[on the second.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="on the second." tags="" position="25,2275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	The second goblin warrior’s taunts are cut short after it takes a mouthful of Brutus’s shield.
The goblin shaman gives one last squeak and keels over, overcome by the poison. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante conjures up a swirling sphere of fire and hurls it at the goblin archer. The nimble archer dances backwards to avoid it—and dodges right into Incerta’s waiting blades. After the body drops, she hastily bends over not the body, but the weapon it once carried. You frown. You look around, but no one else seems to have noticed the rogue’s antics.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Another victory,” Orante hums happily. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Not quite,” Brutus growls, gripping his sword as he storms towards the [[frozen goblin warrior.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="27" name="frozen goblin warrior." tags="" position="25,2400" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	Orante inhales sharply, aware of Brutus’s intentions before anyone else. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Surely that is not necessary—” she begins—but is cut off by the first swing of Brutus’s blade. One ice-encrusted goblin arm falls to the ground, sliced away by the orc knight.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“No one,” he rumbles, chopping off the other arm, “no one calls me weak and lives to tell the tale.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	With a final grunt of effort, he lops the goblin’s head off, the creature’s face trapped in a permanent sneer as it rolls down the beach. Brutus turns to the rest of the party, his jovial smile returning. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Now,” he says triumphantly, “we [[have our victory.”]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="You slowly turn." tags="" position="25,2650" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	“Ah. A troll,” Orante observes. “Must have escaped the fight at the gates.”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The lumbering creature stomps across the beach, an earthshattering bellow breaking free of its malformed face as it carelessly knocks adventurer after adventurer aside. Ranger arrows and mage spells bounce harmlessly off the calcified leather of its flesh, and its massive club—fashioned from an uprooted tree, by the looks of it—sweeps entire parties out of its way. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Finally! A challenge!” Brutus says.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Your party moves towards the troll as it flattens another adventuring party. You hurry along behind them, clutching your robes so you [[do not trip.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="do not trip." tags="" position="25,2775" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	Brutus reaches the troll first, slashing at the thick folds of flesh pillowing around its legs. His sword apparently slices something vital, for the troll stumbles and falls on one knee with a startled cry—but not before smashing its club into Brutus and sending the orc knight flying. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Orante casts Fireball. The orb of flame splashes across the troll’s flattened face, lighting the sparse hairs on its scalp on fire. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The troll paws at the new pain on its head in confusion, absentmindedly swinging its club, the crude weapon’s blunt end nearly hitting Incerta and Orante. The rogue hastily uses Dodge; she almost seems to recede into her own shadow, shrinking back and avoiding all harm. Orante, on the other hand, does not avoid any harm at all—rather, she is flung several feet backwards, her tome tumbling from her grasp.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	[[It is your turn to act.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="It is your turn to act." tags="" position="25,2900" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	You glance around wildly, considering your options, trying to think above the hammering of your heart.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	[[You could use Mend.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	[[You could use Blind.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	[[Or you could cease this masquerade.]] You did not join the Adventurers’ Guild to do poorly as a guardian. You came here to be the best &lt;%= s.ROLE %&gt; the land has ever seen.
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="31" name="You could use Mend." tags="" position="25,3025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	You try to summon what concentration you have left, doing your best to stifle the doubting clamor at the back of your mind. You direct your scepter towards Brutus, channeling Mend. He gives a violent cough and manages to struggle back onto his feet, sword and shield in hand. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Did I help?” you ask.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	He coughs again.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Yes! Of course, younglin’!” he shouts back, but the way he gingerly touches his ribs [[suggests otherwise.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="You could use Blind." tags="" position="150,3025" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	You try to summon what concentration you have left, doing your best to stifle the doubting clamor at the back of your mind. You direct your scepter towards the troll, channeling Blind. A dull glow emanates from the end of your scepter. The troll stares dumbly at it, hardly blinded, but certainly mesmerized by the little flickering light.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	 Brutus gives a violent cough and manages to struggle back onto his feet, sword and shield in hand. He gives your scepter a decidedly unimpressed look.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Ah, yes, just…keep doin’ that, recruit, keep him distracted,” the orc knight shouts.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	His yelling snaps the troll out of its hypnosis. With an incensed roar, it charges at your party [[once more.-&gt;suggests otherwise.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="Or you could cease this masquerade." tags="" position="275,3025" size="100,100">&lt;div hidden class=&quot;knight&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You charge the troll, raising your buckler as if it is a kite shield, brandishing your scepter as if it is a sword. Brutus gives a startled yell.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“What are you doin’, recruit?!” 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You ignore him and continue running forward. The troll gives a heaving roar and swings its club at you. You stumble out of the way just in time, sand spraying around you as the club smashes into the ground. Seeing your opening in the troll’s sluggish reflexes and slow recovery, you smash the knobbed end of your scepter against its fingers. There is a crack, a deafening grunt of pain—and then the troll reels backwards, nursing its broken hand, [[club forgotten.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div hidden class=&quot;mage&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You drop your scepter and buckler, instead picking Orante’s tome up from where it fell in the sand. Brutus gives a startled yell.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“What are you doin’, recruit?!”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You ignore him and flip to a dogeared page, hands already moving through the air in complex patterns, lips already moving in the shapes of incantations. You slip into the role of mage with utmost ease—and, for the first time since you embarked on this adventure, you feel completely comfortable and entirely capable.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	A thick shell of ice winds up the troll’s legs, fixing it to the ground. It gives an incensed roar, struggling against its sudden bonds, but [[it cannot move.-&gt;club forgotten.]]
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div hidden class=&quot;rogue&quot;&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You run as swiftly as you can towards the troll, praying you do not trip over your robes. Brutus gives a startled yell.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“What are you doin’, recruit?!”
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
   	You ignore him and hurl your buckler at the troll. The round, wooden shield smashes into its nose with a soft crunch; the troll lurches backwards, clutching at its face in pain. Taking advantage of this distraction, you run behind the troll and begin clambering up its back, using the tufts of hair sprouting from its hardened skin as handholds until your feet are planted on its shoulders. You take your scepter and plunge its sharper end into the troll’s eye.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The massive creature gives a wail of pain and shudders to its knees, pitching you off its shoulders and [[into the sand.-&gt;club forgotten.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;%
    $(&#39;#passage&#39;).ready( () =&gt; {
        setTimeout( () =&gt; {

	Brutus charges towards the troll once more as Incerta circles behind the massive creature. As the knight distracts the troll with his glancing sword blows and clanging shield, the rogue runs up the misshapen monster’s back, nimble and noiseless. Before the troll can even realize there is an unwanted guest standing on its shoulders, Incerta slices its throat.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	It stands there for a moment, swaying, too dumb to register its own demise. It gives one last groan, and then finally collapses in a spray of sand, Incerta gracefully leaping clear. The final foe on the beach has been felled by a stunning display of teamwork and skill—and you? You could only watch uselessly.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You feel shame burn hotly on your cheeks, turning away as the rest of the adventurers on the beach [[cheer.]]
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="cheer." tags="" position="25,3275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Incerta helps Orante up. The elf woman holds her head, looking a little dazed. Brutus strides over to you, grinning triumphantly. He slaps you on the shoulder.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Congratulations on finishin’ your first adventure in one piece!” he laughs. 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You try to smile, try to laugh and celebrate with the other adventurers as you all return to the city, but the victory feels empty. [[You feel hollow.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="36" name="club forgotten." tags="" position="275,3150" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Brutus and Incerta stare, utterly bewildered by your sudden behavioral shift. However, it does not take them long to recognize the opening you have just given them, and they hastily surge forward to aid you. As the troll reels with pain, Brutus charges it from the front, and Incerta circles around to its rear. While the knight lays blow after blow upon its tough hide, the rogue runs up the misshapen monster’s back, nimble and noiseless. Before the troll can even realize there is an unwanted guest standing on its shoulders, Incerta slices its throat.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	It stands there for a moment, swaying, too dumb to register its own demise. It gives one last groan, and then finally collapses in a spray of sand, Incerta gracefully leaping clear. The final foe on the beach has been felled by a stunning display of teamwork and skill—and you? You helped.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You gave your party members the advantage they needed to slay the troll. You feel a surge of triumph fill you as the rest of the adventurers on the beach [[cheer.-&gt;cheer2]]
&lt;/div&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="37" name="cheer2" tags="" position="275,3275" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Incerta helps Orante up. The elf woman holds her head, looking a little dazed. Brutus approaches you, his grin at once victorious and vaguely bemused. He grips your shoulder.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“That was…quite somethin’, younglin’. I have never quite seen anythin’ like it, but…” He pauses, his look of confusion only growing. “But good on you for your quick thinkin’. And congratulations on finishin’ your first adventure in one piece.” 
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You give him a broad smile of your own, and fall in line with the other laughing and celebrating adventurers as you all [[return to the city.]] 
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="38" name="return to the city." tags="" position="775,25" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	You return to Cysa, your packs spilling over with spoils, your armor spattered with sand and blood.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You feel exhilarated, your triumphs on the beach rekindling the embers of your once-fading eagerness. You walk with a bit of a spring in your step, shoulders back, head held high. As you stride into the guild hall, you have half a mind to boast loudly to the nearest adventurer you can find. This is how you always imagined it would feel—to return, victorious and proud, after a hard day of fighting and adventuring.
&lt;/div&gt;

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="have our victory.”" tags="" position="25,2525" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;
	Incerta makes a soft noise. You start; you have never heard her make any sort of noise, much less speak.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	“Almost,” she mutters, pointing past you.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	And that is when you feel the ground shake beneath you, the air trembling with a deep roar. [[You slowly turn.]]
&lt;/div&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="40" name="You feel hollow." tags="" position="650,25" size="100,100">&lt;div&gt;	
	You return to Cysa, your packs spilling over with spoils, your armor spattered with sand and blood.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You know you should feel triumphant, a veritable champion returning from a day of grueling combat and successful adventuring, and yet…the feelings are empty. Hollowed out by the heavy scepter you carry in your hand. Dampened by the buckler strapped to your arm. The quest was a success. You defeated the minions of Ye Olde Evil and successfully defended the city. So why does it feel as if you are the one who lost in the end?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	You drag yourself into the guild hall, head hanging low.
&lt;/div&gt;
